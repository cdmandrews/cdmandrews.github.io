<p>I am an assistant professor in the English department at TAMUCC. I am a member of the <a href="http://writing.tamucc.edu">Writing Studies</a> faculty, and specialize in technical communication, digital rhetoric, and online ed.</p>
<p>I love working in HTML. It's an important part of my professional work for the discipline; I am on the editorial staff at <a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net">Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy</a> and do lots of web writing and editing there.</p>
<p>Here I shore fragments against my ruin.</p>
