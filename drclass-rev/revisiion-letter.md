# Revision letter for "Cumulus Culminations: Learning to read the clouds"
Christopher Andrews et al.


pick up http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/25.1/praxis/cheatle-et-al/cirrus.html  overview of clouds
and work in https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/24.2/interviews/mcelroy-et-al/scholars.html pedagogy and digital rhetoric

## Reviewer recommendations:
1. wanted to read more about the context of the whole course and the student population
2. a bit more unpacking of the theories (both useful and not-so-useful) of distant reading, particularly better defining jargon:
  - word watchers
  - threshold concepts
3. "what's not shown" in clouds and what general masters students might be able to take away from this in a semester (or not)
4. more on cloud-making as a writerly or compositional act" (i.e. tension between inventional/generative and interpretive/analytical goals)
5. bringing scholarly content that students read to light in the introduction to the assignment
6. beefing up conclusion so impacts are broader, speaking more to the expectations of what students learned and what their outcomes show about the field (see R3)
  - i.e., how would one use the technique being described? Who might benefit from following the author's approach and why?
7. navigational revisions
  - link to next student explanations
  - rename "classroom" page/menu?
  - un-linked clouds where links not needed.


## Finally, feedback on our reviewer questions

It's funny how differently we read simple questions when we're standing on the flipside. Speaking as editorial staff, I think the questions are thoughtful, but realize I may have only given deep thought to some of the most-recently added questions (i.e trying to figure out how to ask about methods and citing inclusively).

Now speaking as one of the reviewed, I think the questions offer--on the whole--a reasonable measuring stick. One always wonders how broad questions will be applied to their particular situation, and I think that the reviewers exercised a great deal of phronesis in their use of the heuristic. I do look at that first question: "is it new?" and wonder if it's really the right way to put that. Considering some of our recent T1 reviewing re: blogs and zines, I wonder how me might reflect this quality without equating it to novelty. That is, the problem with the blogs piece that we reviewed recently wasn't that blogs are old hat--after all, they're still a popular and usable tool in classrooms and platforms everywhere. Rather, there was something to the framing--that I'm still trying to figure out as I continually learn how to dev edit generously. It's not that it's not novel, and it's not that it's not original. On both of those counts, one could possibly mark down my ow clouds webtext--teaching/classroom research isn't exactly about novelty, and the reviewers make that distinction. For each reviewer, there's a pretty clear understanding about the purpose or scope of each section. I wonder if this question might be better as something about Is the webtext appropriate to the scope of its proposed section?
