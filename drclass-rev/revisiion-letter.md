# Revision letter for "Cumulus Culminations: Learning to read the clouds"
Christopher Andrews et al.

what to do with "cloud storage" or "cloud transfer"??

pick up http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/25.1/praxis/cheatle-et-al/cirrus.html  overview of clouds,

https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11528-014-0750-9.pdf (clouds and assessment--strengths and weaknesses as a graphical representation)

-  "quick, intuitive sense of a text" by relying on high-level data and visual, artistic presentation (DePaolo and Wilkinson, 2014, p. 44).

and work in https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/24.2/interviews/mcelroy-et-al/scholars.html pedagogy and digital rhetoric

## Reviewer recommendations:
1. wanted to read more about the context of the whole course and the student population
2. a bit more unpacking of the theories (both useful and not-so-useful) of distant reading, particularly better defining jargon:
  - word watchers
  - threshold concepts
    - going to pull back from this concept, it wasn't so important--might mention that students thought of these as maybe offering threshold concepts (as they'd been introduced to them earlier in other courses, but that's not realyl what they offer--words are not fully-fledged statements like TCs are...)
3. "what's not shown" in clouds and what general masters students might be able to take away from this in a semester (or not)
  --guess here's where the TC got in the... way?
  -- Introductory nature, and really showing off the weakness of clouds as infovizzes, they really demand a lot from readers/writers, you have to know the text, the context, to really "read" them and ultimately the readings are fairly surface after all???  Mueller's clouds are useful to experienced WS folx and professionalizing WS folx because we have these words pre-screened already. We know what they mean (or think we do), but when you're coming at them fresh, they really do seem to be just words...
4. more on cloud-making as a writerly or compositional act" (i.e. tension between inventional/generative and interpretive/analytical goals)
    cloud-making as compositional act
    distant reading as writerly, inventional act. (connect to Ramsey's Reading Machines)
5. bringing scholarly content that students read to light in the introduction to the assignment
6. beefing up conclusion so impacts are broader, speaking more to the expectations of what students learned and what their outcomes show about the field (see R3)
  - i.e., how would one use the technique being described? Who might benefit from following the author's approach and why?
  - get at "what's shown" and "what's not shown"
  - what's useful, what's not.
  - and digital rhetoric is diverse and big and hard to get into from the broader survey-sense of eyman etc. You might have to come in from a more specific angle, and then present "o here are these other things"
7. navigational revisions
  - link to Next Student's Clouds explanations (dun it) (and considering more)
  - rename "classroom" page/menu? (working on it)
  - un-linked clouds where links not needed. (dun it)

  - add skip to content nav link
  - explore skip content link for word clouds?
