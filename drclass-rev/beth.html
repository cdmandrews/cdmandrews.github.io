    <h2>On Usefulness</h2>
    <p>I come to this word cloud project from the perspective of an upcoming graduate from the Masters of Arts in English program at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. As an undergraduate student, I was an art major with double minors in creative and technical writing. After I graduate, I plan to go down a non-academic path. I would love to work as a writer in either the marketing, editing, or grant writing field. From my art background, I tend to approach new ideas by wondering how I can apply them in real life. I learned new theories and techniques by directly using them. Painting techniques were learned by painting. Color theory was learned by pasting colored paper together to understand how they affect each other.</p>

    <p>At first, I found word clouds to be interesting, but pretty much useless. I come from a background in art and I plan to pursue non-academic fields of work after graduation. The only use I could see for word clouds was inside of academia. For example, if I were in the beginning of my career as an English graduate student then perhaps they might be of more interest since they could be a new tool to utilize in future courses. However, as I am at the end of the program and do not currently intend to return to academia, I struggled to find that hook that would draw me in to them.</p>

    <p>It was through a conversation with several of my classmates, Nicole, Kelsey, Emille, and Ethan, that I thought of some personal use for them. I am currently in the process of a job hunt. I am also focusing on writing studies in my degree with a focus in grant writing. Word clouds, I found, might have a useful application for both. In both job and grant applications, certain key terms or buzz words are used and an applicant could, and should, mirror many of those common terms in their own application. In the digital age, many companies and grant funders use computers to scan applications to see how many of the key terms they are searching for are included. Those who do not meet a certain threshold do not move on. These clouds can be used to scan these applications and identify which words are most commonly used. Then, with a word bank of buzz words, the process of building the application might be helped along. It would make easier the identification of these key terms.</p>

    <p>It was also during the course of this conversation that I came to understand why I had been struggling with the concept of word clouds for such a long time. My background in art and writing is very â€˜learning by doing' and I didn't see a way to approach word clouds from that angle. To me, they were this static thing that, once created, didn't have much use other than viewing. I don't find that useful because it was very academic to me.</p>

    <p>I'm not sure if the concept of being "useful" is a place where one should begin when approaching a concept, but it's where I begin. I'm certain others would find word clouds to be useful, whether they are venturing further into academia or if they are simply in a different field (Nicole is in social media, where word clouds are actually used quite often). But without a solid application that is useful for me, I just find myself apathetic about something. In <cite>Network Sense: Methods for Visualizing a Discipline</cite>, Derek N. Mueller described word clouds as "an eclectic collection that indicates how distant reading and thin description can be used to render apprehensible nonobvious patterns intrinsic to complex and relatively large data sets" (2017 p. 44). Word clouds create a "thin description... [that] makes experience accessible (albeit partially accessible) and durative (albeit limitedly durative)" (p. 48). This accurately describes my feelings on word clouds. They have their uses, however those uses are incredibly limited. Yes, they can process and allow one to understand huge amounts of information, but they also don't really tell the reader a whole lot in the process&mdash;at least not by themselves.</p>
