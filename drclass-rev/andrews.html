      <h2>But why clouds?</h2>
      <p>As the instructor, I had three goals for the assignment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We would use distant reading as a method of inquiry to introduce a part of the set of theories and practices (i.e. the academic discipline) called digital rhetoric (Eyman, 2015)</li>
        <li>We would interpret the process and results of our distant readings through digital rhetorical theory, partiuclarly as it pushes against and updates concepts from traditional rhetorical theory (Brooke, 2009)</li>
        <li>We would use the artifacts we created with our distant reading to author our own digital texts; the class learned markdown, HTML/CSS and a variety of web publishing technologies through the framework of lo-fi digital production (Stolley, 2017).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Students also had these broad goals for the course in mind as they interpreted the assignment, as presented on the syllabus:</p>
        <blockquote>We will survey scholarship in digital rhetoric and explore the relevance of that work for composition teaching and professions in writing and technical communication. You will practice digital research methods such as distant reading to develop a research project on a topic of your choosing. You will also add to your technical and rhetorical skills to evaluate and compose accessible and usable digital texts, including building your own personal or professional profile/portfolio site.</blockquote>

      <p>For me, the problem of how (or even whether) to introduce a field is a tough one to solve, and has been especially so when I’ve tried to teach versions of a graduate course in digital rhetoric. Should I focus on a general introduction and survey, emphasizing core, canonical theories (and texts) that students will be able to build upon in later study? How do I balance that with the deeply diverse and inclusive contemporary state of the field? How do I help my students manage breadth and depth? Is that binary even meaningful? What about just coming in and getting the work done? These questions are, as always, complicated by the institutional contexts of my course and graduate program and the disciplinary contexts (or, often, lack thereof) of the students in that course. Master's-level students in English occupy a curious in-between space; they are not only transitioning to graduate-level reading and writing, but are also often experiencing subdisciplines like composition studies or digital rhetoric for the first time (Frederick et al, 2020; Henderson &amp; Cook, 2020). In our relatively small 36-hour generalist Master of Arts in English with specializations (only nominal, of about 6 hours) in literary or writing studies, at a region-serving Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), I can expect to be truly introducing students to fundamental concepts of digital rhetorical theory&mdash;not to mention rhetorical theory itself.</p>

      <p>Frankly, it’s a lot to pin on some word clouds...</p>

      <h3>Condensation: Where clouds come from</h3>
      <p>The desire to map or describe the boundaries of composition studies, composition and rhetoric, and writing studies is well-established in the field’s scholarship (Miller, Licastro, and Belli, 2016). This geneaological problem of “situating oneself in the field” or "introducing a discipline” was for me precedented in two specific ways. The first came from my own experiences as an MA-level graduate teaching assistant. As graduate teaching assistants, we were tasked with joining and lurking on the WPA-LISTSERV (an assignment I know others have done, from anecdotal reporting on that listserv over the years, though today such an assignment might seem more like disciplinary hazing than enculturation). Our graduate director encouraged us to read the list <strong>inventively</strong>: Instead of presenting  a singular representative version of composition and rhetoric, our WPA-L lurking was intended to help us broaden our own horizons and invent the discipline for ourself a bit, seeing what sorts of ideas, topics, attitudes, and behaviors (sometimes bad behaviors) typified members of that community. We would write about and discuss the threads we saw and studied both in a teaching practicum and in individual meetings with the graduate teaching director, connecting threads and discussions to pedagogical problems and theoretical texts in composition and rhetoric.</p>

      <p>The second and more direct inspiration for this assignment is Derek Mueller’s work in </cite>Network Sense: Methods for Visualizing a Discipline</cite>. In his closing chapters, Mueller explicitly offered distant reading methods as appropriate for “newcomers and initiates” to the field who are trying to figure out “where to begin” (p. 168), both in the sense of professional beginnings (using distant/thin reading to figure out which graduate schools to apply to based on the results of distant reading of faculty and alumni publications) and in the sense of those opening steps down a line of inquiry, steps including indexing texts from a particular publication or tracing key terms in the scholarly record (p. 169). Both of these precedents&mdash;along with the fairly common activity among my own and other graduate cohorts of creating Wordles and other word clouds of my own writing after these tools became available&mdash;engage in proairetic readings of the discipline: synoptic views and interfaces with the larger texts of the field afforded by their own (very different) digital texts. </p>
