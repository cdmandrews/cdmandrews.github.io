    <h2>On use and fun</h2>
    <p>We often asked ourselves what "use" these word clouds might have. After discussing with my classmates, I realized that "useful" is a very subjective word and that our individual backgrounds will influence a lot what we find helpful or not. <a href="sydney.html">Sydney</a>, for instance, said that they found the word clouds were not really useful because the words were not contextualized; in other words, we lacked the information necessary to know what those words we were seeing were referencing, which will not allow us to get a clear idea about the issues. I found this perspective interesting, mostly because for me it was the opposite.</p>

    <p>Mueller (2017) cautioned us that we should not underestimate the importance of word clouds just because they are "fun" and "methodologically casual," when, in fact, word clouds can be good indicators of trends and threshold concepts concerning the studied texts. I think that this part was what tricked many of us when doing this assignment. From what I could hear from my classmates who did not find the assignment useful, there seemed to be mixed feelings about what this tool could do. I wonder whether part of that had to do with the already laid-back nature of the word clouds. Is it easier to find something useless if we think it is fun? I would venture to speculate that maybe this assignment threw many of us off depending on whether we were at the beginning or at the end of our program. For those of us starting the program, it could have been a matter of this type of assignment not corresponding to what we would traditionally expect as a grad school assignment&mdash;the first thing we might have been expecting were papers and research. For those who have been in the program for longer, it might also have been the case that they were used to writing papers, and this exercise caught them out of guard because they have been disciplined in a particular way. This might speak to how hard it is to reconciliate traditional scholarship with newer methods of conveying information.</p>

    <p>What I find the most interesting about these word clouds is the fact that they allow us to just get a sense of what could be waiting for us, should we choose to look deeper into the issues at the origin of the word cloud. <a href="kelsy.html">Kelsy’s</a> original word clouds are a great example of this&mdash;and I would go on record just to say that they are the most beautiful word clouds of the ones created, aesthetically speaking. But, even if we take the colors and typefaces away, it was by looking at Kelsy’s word clouds that I first realized why word clouds were useful and what they might be useful for. Most of the words found on Kelsy's clouds referred to topics that I’m very interested in, such as feminism, sexuality, women, etc., and it was after seeing those clouds that I had the idea of going to the webpage of the journal she made them from, and actually looking at the different articles they have published. I found the journal, <cite>Peitho</cite>, to have a strong feminist focus. I went through their page, even clicked the "submit" button to check their guidelines because, why not, maybe one day I could send an article to that journal. So, I think that this could definitely be a way that word clouds could be useful: to give a snapshot of what you may&mdash;or may not&mdash;find in a journal. And even if the lack of context might lead to disappointment, it can also be a way for a new grad student to get acquainted with what is out there.</p>
