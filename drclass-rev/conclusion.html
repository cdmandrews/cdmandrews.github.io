      <h2>Clouds up close at 25,000 feet</h2>
      <blockquote>All maps have their biases and shortcomings—but that recognition shouldn’t keep us from trying different representations and experimenting with different kinds of text clouds to see how and why they serve our rhetorical purposes” (Selfe &amp; Selfe, 2013 p. 33)</blockquote>

      <p>So what were these clouds <strong>good for</strong> in the end? Students found them intellectually stimulating if sometimes frustrating. They were compelling examples that we leaned on hard to understand interface, proairesis, and pattern (Brooke 2009). They were also useful in thinking about being methodological and working with data and computation&mdash;in thinking about the ways <em>why we look</em> and <em>how we look</em> are related. They supported our practical exploration of digital production and understanding how markup languages, structure, and content work together. And finally, the inventional capacity of this kind of reading was powerful&mdash;students found themselves considering aspects of teaching, accessibility, creativity, utility, reading and research, and more as a result of reading clouds. But not everything was quite so sunny.</p>

      <p>Some students resisted the idea that text clouds might be a legitimate mode of reading such that it didn't seem to have even mattered <em>what</em> we were trying to distant read. As prompted, much of their reflection revolved around usefulness and utility, and on this mark word clouds failed the hardest. The sense that word clouds are fun toys with a playful visual rhetoric really pushed against taking them seriously. As one student put it (and many reflections display), students across the timeline of the program—both new and about-to-graduate—had moments of confusion that were rooted in their expectations about the medium and what counts as graduate school work (i.e. writing seminar papers or doing narrowly defined bibliographic research). Some folks really took to the clouds; others fought them. From the perspective of <cite>Lingua Fracta</cite>, we might say that this facet of word clouds really impresses on us the “new” parts of new media and digital rhetoric as we left behind our normal way of interfacing with scholarly texts and tried something that seemed very experimental.</p>

      <p>In the end, our experience with word clouds supports Mueller's notion that distant reading methods can be an engaging entry point for newcomers. As radically different interfaces with texts, clouds have a profound inventional capacity. At the same time the limitations of this assignment remind us of the inherent difficulty of entry points. Anyone can look at a map, but not everyone can read one.</p>

      <p>Generating text clouds is a simple activity, but the visualizations produced are more complex than they might seem. <span class="revision">(mark out some stuff from Cheatle et al here?)</span> Clouds can reveal patterns we might not see otherwise, but can’t reveal explanations for those patterns, and often leave us with many more questions than answers. Interpreting clouds and answering those questions is, as with any kind of research, much more difficult than making them in the first place. (Palmeri &amp; McCorkle 2017; Selfe &amp; Selfe, 2013). Word frequency data does not&mdash;as some students reminded us&mdash;speak for itself. Without a frame of reference, word frequency is just pretty colors and words on a page. Many of Selfe and Selfe’s questions for interpreting word clouds (such as “What terms seem to be missing and why?”) depend on an already-codified understanding of what the corpus represents and contains in the first place. For those who have an internalized sense of a body of knowledge, field, or discipline and want to utilize word clouds to map and visualize, Selfe and Selfe’s detailed heuristic for developing rhetorical word clouds in <cite>Solving Problems in Technical Communication</cite> can be useful, and word clouds can provoke interesting questions.</p>

      <p>Along with issues coming from <a href="assignment.html">the instructor’s presentation</a>, the major limitation for this kind of project was students’ limited frame of reference for digital rhetoric (for rhetoric itself, for that matter). Our word clouds were most compelling as explanatory examples of particular elements of digital rhetoric and hypertext theory. But when seen in the context of expansive claims we might make about the connections distant and thin readings enable for newcomers, word clouds are certainly no panacaea. Mueller (2017) admitted that word clouds are not robust tools for word watching; we have many examples of publications that show the substantial capacity of distant reading for scholarship in writing studies. When compiled with the transitional level of our own context as Master of Arts students (Frederick et al, 2020; Henderson &amp; Cook, 2020), the struggle to invent connections in a new field was intense. Students needed more context&mdash;to be closer to those terms. These kinds of projects would likely be more useful in a doctoral program, where students might have had more time to read and think about their space in a professional academic discipline.</p>

      <p>Still, we’re not without our silver lining: students in the class responded positively to the spirit of recursive, iterative experiment and play that typified our work with the clouds. Their ability to resist nailed-down heuristic interpretations remind us that text is about possibility. As Faris et al noted, play and failure have a role to play as parts of our rhetorical practices (2018). As children, we may have stared up at clouds and figured them into shapes in our minds&mdash;as adults, the same capacity for imagination and invention remain critical for us as writers, communicators, teachers, and scholars.</p>
