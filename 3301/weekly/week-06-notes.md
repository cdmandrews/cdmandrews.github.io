[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)
# Overview for Week 6

## Pics or it didn't happen
Humans are incredibly visual creatures. Look at any Instagram account and you will see evidence that we are able to communicate rich, specific information in an incredibly short time with a picture. (Insert that clich√© we all know about a thousand words here.)

As your readings made clear, professional communicators often rely on  **illustrations**  along with or instead of words to convey our messages. We can break illustrations into two categories:  **tables**  and  **figures**. Depending on your academic background, you may or may not have a lot of experience working with tables and figures, but as professional writers, alternate methods of presenting data and information are valuable. You must be able to decide when to use an illustration and evaluate whether or not your illustration will be effective.

## Visuals with purpose

Think back to that &quot;Know&quot; photograph in the Ready Corpus Christi hurricane preparedness flier a few weeks ago. I look at it, and it's kind of weird: it was a good quality photo, and while it was thematically relevant, it didn't fit the brief, informative purpose of the document. The photo also took up too much space on the page; the space might have been better suited to more complete information about emergency routes or the ReverseAlert system.

- quality graphics
- kinds of graphics
- ethical graphics
- accessible graphics

## Tuesday

Participate in your group's "Communicating with visuals" forum according to the prompt below:
  1. Analyze and discuss different types of illustrations in this EPA document, [Tackling Bed Bugs: A Starter Guide for Local Government](http://npic.orst.edu/pest/bedbug/tacklingbbstarterguide.pdf). Using principles from your readings, evaluate the effectiveness of the guide;s visuals:
    1. What is the document's specific purpose and specific audience? (Hint: It is NOT the &quot;general public&quot; or &quot;people who have bedbugs in their houses.&quot;)
    2. How effective are illustrations in the document? That is, are tables and figures well-suited to the document's purpose and audience? What are the illustrations there to *do*?
    4. Are illustrations genuinely informative or are they decorative?
    3. What do you notice about the creator's methods of numbering, labeling, and citation? Which guidelines in your readings do they follow?
  3. **Be sure to reply and respond to your group member's posts over the course of the week. Do you concur with their evaluation?**

# Thursday

Continue working on your researching skills and finish the "Power Searching with Google" course. For this Thursday, complete the following:
 - Complete Units 4, 5, and 6. Do all unit activities except for the embedded discussion forum posts.
 - Complete the post-course assessment
 - Take a screenshot of your post-course assessment when you have successfully completed it.

Finish the Power Searching 2 assignment in the week 06 folder.
  1. Summarize what new things you have learned about power searching. (No shorter than 150 words)
  3. Describe strategies you might use for finding examples of professional writing from your field. The upcoming major projects will ask you to use all your primary research skills to locate examples of professional writing to analyze and report on, so thinking about these strategies ahead of time will be useful.
  3. **Actually, go ahead and insert some links or pdfs to three examples of professional writing from your field.**
  4. Post the screenshot of your post-course assessment.
