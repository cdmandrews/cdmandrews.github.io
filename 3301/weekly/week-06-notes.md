# Notes and Overview for Week 6
[ENGL 3301, Fall 2021](../calendar.html)

This week, along with the two weekly assignments, you should continue working on, researching for, and asking questions about [your own fact sheets](../project-1). This "[facts about fact sheets](facts-about-fact-sheets)" page puts together many of your observations about the examples you looked at last week. I will also make some student examples available through Blackboard in the Weeks 04-08 folder.

## Tech writing, style, and ethics: Who's kicking whom?

> Langauge changes over time. It always has. Our expectations of appropriate style also change over time. They always have.  (Janice Redish, *Letting Go of the Words*)

This week's readings are about two topics. **Style and ethics**. This intro section is a little long, but it will help you think about where we're going.  My notes this week are also a little long, but will help you tease out connections between style (and design) and justice in TPW.

Our first topic is **style**. Style the way you express your ideas in a document, from the paragraph level to sentence structure and the words and phrases you use. *Style* is different from *correctness*, which has to do with squeaky-clean grammar, mechanics, and spelling. As your reading this week will point out, style guidelines (such as the 7Cs) can conflict with each other, and there are always tradeoffs. You need to be able to **notice** different styles when you see them and **make decisions** about when to use a particular style or not.

*Oh by the way, this ain't no grammar course. I ain't fixin' your grammar for fifteen weeks. What I'd really like to focus us on this week&mdash;and beyond&mdash;is how we make choices with our words and sentences and the implications of those choices. What's style got to do with audience? Purpose? Context? And what the heck does "clear" mean?*

The messy thing about style is that there are LOTS of rules, and that those rules are bound up in context, purpose, and audience. The answer to everything in this course is rhetoric: what's going to work best for my particular readers in their particular situations in their particular use-contexts? Write thusly.

Our second topic is **ethics and justice**. At the center of technical communication is the idea that technologies and the communication that surrounds them should support human dignity and human rights. Rather than only being concerned with being efficient or easy (yes, those are important), we should first of all be sensitive to the fact that tech comm is **for people** and should be **effective**. It affects people: it can help them or it can hurt them, it can confuse or it can clarify. It can enhance difference or erase it. It can advocate for change, or it can reinforce harmful perspectives and epistemologies.

Just following rules of thumb for good writing is not enough. You've got to think about what you say and how your audience will be affected by it. Sadly, we can read about people communicating unethically, unjustly, or just plain awfully just about every day--and we can see (or worse, experience) the implications of their failure to be ethical. Writers and professionals of all kinds should consider their ethical obligations, major types of unethical communication (whether intentional or unintentional), and issues around using copyrighted information in professional organizations.

<mark>Assigned to read this week:</mark>

- [TWE Chapter 2: Professional Style](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/part/style/) overviews the usual sorts of style issues in technical writing, and you'll want to focus on the following three sections:
  - [2.1 Reader-Centered Writing](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/readercentred/)
  - [2.2 Communicating with Precision](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/communicatingprecision/)
  - [2.3 Writing to Persuade](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/writingpersuade/)

-  [OTC Chapter 3, Ethics in Technical Communication](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/8b530f4b-5942-4071-845a-0a138601da10). The video in this chapter is definitely worth. your. time. Yes, it's a little longish, and yes it's just slightly dated in one or two areas, but on the whole it's solid. (In 2020, singular "they" is increasingly accepted as an appropriate nongendered usage. Also, the "use African-American/European-American vs use Black/White" topic has moved a bit since this video.)

<mark>Optional resources for this week:</mark>

- This short resource on [ethical presentation of research and data](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/technicalwriting/chapter/9-3-typical-ethics-issues-in-technical-writing/), which includes the following topics:
    - selecting, cherry-picking, and suppressing information
    - presenting visual data ethically
- [TWE Chapter 3.5 Style tips: Revising to Enhance Readability](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/styletipsreadability/) is not required, but is a good checklist to come back to.


### Reader-centered vs. Writer-centered style

Whenever possible, write so that busy people understand what you are saying the first time they read it. You don't have to snazz it up; help your reader's valuable attention by focusing your sentences on the most important thing. Keep things simple! One way writers can do this is by using **reader-centered** messages that make clear how the message will affect readers. Reader-focused writers look at the situation from the reader's point of view and adjust content, structure, and tone to meet their needs.

Reader-centered messages use the pronoun "you" to center the message on the reader, while writer-centered messages rely on "I" and "we." Reader-centered messages use what's called a **"you attitude"**. To write with a "you attitude":
1. Focus on what the reader needs and values
2. In neutral or positive situations, use reader-focused pronouns (you)
3. Avoid discussing your own feelings
4. Refer to specific, relevant information

Three short examples showing the difference between writer-centered and reader-centered statements:
>  "I have worked hard to get you the best contract possible."

In this first  example the writer emphasizes how they worked rather than the benefits that the reader will receive. Sure, it's nice that they worked hard, but that's not really the important message. See also letters saying "We are excited to inform you that..." Some common email phrases that discuss your own feelings instead of getting to the point include "I was wondering if it would be okay if I could..." and "I just wanted to let you know..." It's okay to get to the question.

> "You'll be happy to learn that we're ready to offer you the best contract possible."

In the second example, the writer begins by telling the reader how to feel. And *nobody tells me how to feel*!

> "Under the new contract you'll receive dental insurance."

This third sentence starts with the important information&mdash;the new contract&mdash;and gives specific, relevant details about it. You get dental now. Consider the difference between everyone's favorite Amazon email: "We shipped your order today" versus "Your order will arrive on Thursday." Which sentence works better for the person watching out for porch pirates?

For negative situations, writer-centered messages prove more effective than reader-centered messages because negative reader-centered messages can trigger defensive responses. For instance, “*You need to send us your overdue balance of $550 or we'll probably take you to court*” will likely cause a negative reaction. Compare that to: “*Please pay the overdue balance of $550 to avoid possible legal actions. If you need help making this payment, please contact our credit department for assistance*."  

Along with using "you", writers can also be reader-centered by writing in a conversational tone rather than a stiff, legalistic one: "*The changes agreed upon per our conversation are herein included.*" is exceedingly formal and doesn't really sound like it's written for human consumption. On the other hand, "*The changes included here were the ones we discussed during our telephone conversations*" sounds like there's a person on the other end of the line.

### Technical terms and jargon

Technical terms are essential in technical and professional writing--especially when you're dealing with technical and scientific fields, but also with all kinds of professions and areas. Each field uses a vocabulary to relay specialized concepts by means of technical language. These special terms convey concentrated meanings that have been built up over time and use. Technical terms are really devices for efficiency among experts: they take big ideas and information and condense it all into a single word. The same thing goes for acronyms and abbreviations: when people share knowledge or a discourse community, they can use acronyms and initialisms (RADAR, LARPing, TDY, ADHD, YOLO, ROTFLMAO) and abbreviations (2D, 5G, app, demo, IP) to communicate more quickly and efficiently.

At the same time, technical terms can make your prose dense and difficult to understand, even for the specialized reader. So it's not a question of using it all the time or ignoring it all the time--like everything else, words are choices. If you're going to used specialized terminology, stick to the following guidelines:

- Match terminology to your audience's needs and background. Don't assume they know it all. What is their level of understanding of the topic? Do you need to use more general terms?  
- Provide clear definitions or explanations of unfamiliar terms. If you are using a specialized term that is not widely used in your audience, even if the audience is an expert one, be sure you provide a clear definition of your term. That just helps everyone be on the same page.
- If you want to use an acronym that's not popularly known, spell out the entire thing the first time you use it and provide the acronym in parenthesis directly afterward. Then you can use the acronym for the rest of your document.
- Use a terminology list when you are introducing a variety of new terms into your discussion. Glossaries or terminology lists, very common in science and engineering, helps readers who want to remind themselves what you mean by a term.

Also be aware of how [jargon can be used to dress up or obfuscate the truth](https://plainlanguage.gov/resources/articles/keep-it-jargon-free/). Are we in a "period of economic readjustment," or a "recession"? Is your company "implementing a skills mix adjustment" or "downsizing" or did you really just get fired?

## Ethics: Technical writing is for people
In technical communication circles (especially scholarly ones), there is a well-known article by Steven Katz titled "The Ethic of Expediency." ([Katz, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/378062?seq=1)) Katz discusses the criteria by which we should judge a piece of technical communication. Is a memo good because it's flawlessly written from a stylistic and organizational perspective, or is it good because of some higher standard? Then Katz presents a 1942 memo detailing improvements to Nazi gassing vans: “By any formal criteria in technical communication, it is an almost perfect document”—organization, purpose, document design, accuracy, logic, and style are all by the book. But the memo is, as Katz claims, “too technical, too logical” in its horrifyingly unconcerned treatment of human extermination (p. 197). The problem—here taken to an extreme we would call hyperbolic if it weren’t so real&mdash;is a focus on **expediency: “on technical criteria as a means to an end”** (p. 197).

Expediency is all about getting to the end result: by this faulty logic a technical success is also an ethical success. The “officially sanctioned ethos grounded in expediency” is, for Katz, deeply complicit in the memo’s rhetoric. He suggests that “it is the ethic of expediency that enables deliberative rhetoric and gives impulse to most of our actions in technological capitalism as well”—an ethic that is ultimately dangerous (198). That is, the horrific goals of the Third Reich were supported and promoted through the efficiency/expediency logics inherent to technical culture and technical writing. The holocaust becomes a result of Western expediency, of Western culture, rather than just an aberration."

I'm just going to put out there right now that I think **good tech writing can't be neutral**--that it must put people at the center, that it must value human life and dignity, that it can and should encompass cultural difference, that no duh if we're going to be all about audiences than we should take into account native languages and experiences of readers. The fundamental truth of how I've taught TC for years is "you are not your user." That is, the people who are reading/using/affected by your communication are **different** than you, and in all kinds of ways. There is no monoculture; there is no single way of being and doing in the world. That difference is a good thing. And it's also a communication problem for you to resolve--but you never ever do that by making things harder for your audience.

**Burying (Hiding?) important information.** For example, [this ICE memo released on July 6 2020 by the US Department of Homeland Security](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/bcm2007-01.pdf). The memo explains to college administrators that their international (nonimmigrant) students must take either onsite courses or a mix of onsite and online courses in the Fall 2020 semester to remain in the United States. Unfortunately, the memo is generally unclear, burying information in long, dense paragraphs and sentences. Look at the following sentence:
> If a school changes its operational stance mid-semester, and as a result a nonimmigrant student switches to only online classes, or a nonimmigrant student changes their course selections, and as a result, ends up taking an entirely online course load, schools are reminded that nonimmigrant students within the United States are not permitted to take a full course of study through online classes

If you can parse that statement, you'll find a pretty significant policy explanation, considering our experiences starting in Spring 2020 and through the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Look at the memo again and try to find that sentence. Burying such a key fact in a long, passive sentence in a long, dense, paragraph in the middle of a long memo raises some serious ethical questions. It's bad enough that it's a cruel policy, but what are the implications of that statement in particular being located where it is? Without grilling the writers we can't truly know _why_ it's buried (are they mean or are they just a bad writer?), but we can think about the _effects and implications_ of someone doing it.

**AKA oppression through content prioritization.** Or here's another one. Go to the [DHS ICE website](https://www.ice.gov/) and look at the menu options. Compare the menu in English to the menu en Espa&ntilde;ol. What's changed in one version to the other? What's prioritized in each? Note how numerous content tabs are removed from the Spanish version of the site, including the "Careers" link under "About us." This tab includes career opportunities and other content. What does its complete removal reveal about the goals and perspectives of the organization?

**Audience, justice, ethics.** This week we're opening up our concern with specific audiences and purposes to include justice and ethics, which introduces a number of concerns. It's easy to get into ethics and TPW as a list of do's and don'ts, and I don't only want to do that. What I really like about the chapter you'll read from this week is that it starts by reminding us that ethics is situational and rife with dilemmas: the competing obligations we have to our society, our employer, our profession, our colleagues, our families, and ourselves. You need to be able to identify ethical challenges as they arise in the workplace and you need to be able to resolve them.

"Utility, rights, justice, and care" are complex. I do encourage you to look at some of the "Sample ethical dilemmas" in the Open TC chapter, as they are good examples of communication situations that might have multiple right answers, or where an answer that's right by one metric is totally wrong by another.

This week's material will also help you begin to look for the different ways faulty, unethical, and unjust communication happens--wether intentionally or unintentionally. For example, think about why [clear communication that emphasizes the main message isn't just just "good health communication" but also "ethical health communication"](https://medium.com/wehearthealthliteracy/reimagining-the-coronavirus-postcard-a42bc87d698f).

### Style and inclusive language
<sub>(This article contains material adapted from [Intro to Professional Communications](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/professionalcomms/chapter/4-3-inclusive-language/), CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)</sub>

Good&mdash;ethical, just, human, awesome&mdash;communicators write inclusively and don't make assumptions about their readers. We think about our readers, question our initial assumptions, and write about them in ways that don't reinforce negative stereotypes.

 Some simple ways to write inclusively:
 - Use the singular "they" instead of "he or she." For example, instead of saying, “A communicator should understand his or her audience,” you could say, “A communicator should understand their audience” or “Communicators should understand their audience.” People have been arguing over this one for a while now in the vicious gender-neutral language wars, but it's enjoyed a spendid revival since the 90s. The usage has [a long history (at least since Middle English)](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/), the controversy is old and tired, (at least since the 18th century), and in general singular "they" has seen increased usage since the 1970s. Mostly because people don't notice it unless it's pointed out to them.
 - Be specific when discussing a person's identity and use the terminology they prefer. (Basically, this is the "don't be a jerk" clause.) There is considerable debate ongoing about person-first and identity-first language right now: the difference between the person-first option "person with autism" and identity-first option "autistic person." Neither is right or wrong; instead, this is about how people see themselves in the world; is disability a characteristic of a person's identity, or a secondary attribute? When in doubt, ask the person what terminology they prefer.
 - Question the assumptions that you make about your audience. The monoculture is dead. Consider that many of your readers might not share the same cultural values, experiences, or television shows. For example, a sentence like “Every child waits all year for Christmas morning,” consider that many of your readers might not have shared this experience. Your mainstream 1990's sitcom references are now officially obscure cultural references. Don't assume.

### The 7Cs and style at work.

An appropriate style matters because, as you've been learning, people aren't paid to read your documents. They're paid to work. This work often involves reading things, but that's not the primary focus of most jobs. When you place important information at the beginning of a document rather than the end and when you create short, information-rich paragraphs with clear sentence structures and words appropriate for the audience's reading needs, you help readers understand and act on information safely and efficiently.

I won't go into the 7Cs at length here&mdash;[that's what the textbook is for](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/communicatingprecision/). But I'll add the list here so you can have a quick reference to it. Communication needs to be:
- Clear
- Coherent
- Concise
- Concrete
- Correct
- Complete
- Courteous

One more time for the people in the back: the basic principles of effective style listed in your readings are *all about readers*. While correctness is important, using a style that is understandable and conventional for readers *and* will help them meet their goals *is critical*.


## For Tuesday
Complete the <mark>Elements 2: Writing styles and reader-centered writing individual assignment</mark> before 5:00 on Tuesday.

<em>Like last week, this assignment is individual and not in the forums. For this assignment and the next few Tuesdays, you will revise different aspects of your "Professional sites and resources memo" from Week 5. </em>

1. After reading this week's materials on style, **revisit and revise the language** in your "Professional sites and resources" memo from last week. You are free to rewrite your memo however you like, but should specifically try to enact a **reader-centered style**. Write it with the **"you attitude."** You should also incorporate changes based on last week's feedback. We will work on other elements of the memo (more style, also headings and ovisuals) in the weeks to come.

2. Post your redesigned memo to the "Elements 2: Writing styles and reader-centered writing" assignment in Blackboard. Upload your text as a Word document or PDF.

3. In the "comments" with your submission, reflect briefly on the assignment, explaining why you changed what you changed and what difficulties or successes you had.

## For Thursday

**You are not required to complete this assignment.**

**If you are in need of extra credit** you can participate in the <mark>"TPW, Ethics, and Justice"</mark> discussion thread in your group before 5:00 pm on Thursday.

Go back through the [chapter on Ethics in Technical Communication](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/8b530f4b-5942-4071-845a-0a138601da10) and identify **at least three** specific issues or topics that you see as particularly relevant to you. These might connect to your family and life experiences, to communities you live and work in now, or to professional goals you have for your future.

Topics in that chapter you might select:
      - ethics: utility, rights, justice, and care
      - consequences of faulty communication
      - appropriate language
      - imprecise/biased language
      - copyright and intellectual property
      - analyzing and presenting data ethically

1. Prepare a short slideshow (5+ slides) about why you think those three topics are important.
  - Rather than writing loooong unbroken paragraphs on your slides, use a combination of headings, lists, and paragraphs to discuss issues/topics/principles and describe and give examples for each of them in turn. Think about your audience, and use text and slide formatting to emphasize important information. Make your slides easy to read and follow, and use visuals to provide examples, evidence, or interest.
  - What, specifically, is the role of *communication* in the issues you presented? Can we use communication to do the work for ethics, communities, and justice? Can unethical communication get in the way? How so? What do you see as your role in all of that?
2. Post a link, file, or embed code for your slideshow to the forums along with a brief overview of its contents. Don't forget the overview/summary!!


## Looking ahead

During [Week 7](week-07-notes) we will continue working with style, focusing on parallelism, headings, lists, and other important features. You'll also post a rough, rough draft of your fact sheet (major project 1).
