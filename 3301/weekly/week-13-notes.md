# Overview for Week 13

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

## Big picture

Get it done.

## Tuesday

Work, work, work. That's all. Highly advised to schedule an appointment with your professor. This is not a blow-off week. You should spend the hours you would normally spend reading textbook content, writing discussion posts, or working on other assignments ON YOUR PROJECT.

Schedule a conference with me as needed.

## Thursday

No, seriously. Keep work going on project 2. Check in with the professor or schedule a meeting.

## Looking ahead
[Next week](week-14-notes) you'll do a progress report. We have done one of these on the previous project, so practice what you learned last time as you work on this one. I will provide a template, etc.
