# Notes and Overview for Week 13
[ENGL 3301, Fall 2021](../calendar.html)

## Big Picture

Nothing special this week. It's just **time to &#x1F44F;	Get. &#x1F44F;	Things. &#x1F44F;	 Done.** I've cancelled the discussion assignment for Tuesday. On Thursday, you'll do a first round of peer review on a rough, rough draft.

### Also, some assorted writing tips for you as you're plugging away:

People always ask me about how to start their introduction. The problem is, if you haven't written the document yet, how in the heck can you know what to include in the introduction. Your real introduction can't be the first thing you write, because you probably don't really know what your report is going to say yet. Wait until you have a serious outline or map for where you want to go with some certainty about what your key messages will be before you try to write the introduction.

With that in mind, here are **Dr. Andrews' guidelines for writing introductions**:

1. Write a fake placeholder introduction, which includes the following elements:
  - State the purpose fo the report clearly using a few filler sentences to help yourself get straight:
    - This report will.... (use an action verb: describe? define? evaluate? summarize? argue?)
    - I want my readers to know....
    - I will talk about the following topics: (list, list, list)
  - Come back later to fill in the rest of your introductory section with context and background that will help your reader understand what they're getting into.

Next, here are some ideas about **writing discussion sections**:

1. You have options here. There is not one way to do it! The idea of this kind of reporting is thinking about what you're writing about, who you're writing to, and why you're writing about it.
2. Remember to organize your report by **key message**--by idea, not by document. A "my first document, my second document, my third document" approach doesn't have a key message. *What do you need to tell your audience about those examples you found and looked at*? What's the message? Is it a common theme, technique, or principle? Do you have something to show or teach us?
3. Use concepts from your readings and research as frameworks for organizing your discussions. Some useful frameworks that might help you organize your discussion into meaningful sections:
  - Cassandra Race, six characteristics of technical communication (*focused on audience, rhetorical/persuasive/purposeful/problem-oriented, professional, design-centered, research/technology oriented, ethical*)
  - Douglas Downs, six qualities of rhetoric (rhetoric is *situated, motivated, contingent, interactional, epistemic, embodied*)
  - Adam Pope, definition of technical writing as translation
  - Miles Kimball, qualities of strategic or tactical technical communication (*inside/outside, professional/amateur, invisible/visible, user-centered/user-created, anonymous/personal, authentic/controlled*)
  - OR is there some concept or definition or theme in one of your secondary sources that you can use as an organizing principle for your report? This will depend a lot on what you see in your examples and what's interesting there.

Finally, just to tie the knot, here are **Dr. Andrews guidelines for writing conclusions**

  1. Write your conclusion.
  2. Cut the entire text of your conclusion. (Ctrl-X on a PC, Command-X on a Mac)
  3. Scroll to the top of your document.
  4. Paste your conclusion under the "Introduction" heading. (Ctrl-V on a PC, Command-V on a Mac)
  5. Revise to integrate it with your old introduction--make them flow and make sense together.
  6. Now go back down to the conclusion spot. Don't introduce brand-new stuff. Know that some readers will read the conclusion first! Summarize where you've been, restate the most important key messages, and hammer home one more time with what your reader should take away. Is there a suggested action? An implication to think about? Answers to questions asked in the report? A set of recommendations? A judgment? A prediction?

## Tuesday

Get Sh!+ Done Club will meet at 1:00 to 3:00 pm CST in my WebEx as usual. If you can't make it, you can still schedule an appointment with your professor. (Me.) Otherwise, nothing due today. Write like the wind.

## Thursday

Post a rough draft of your report for Project 2 in your group's "Project 2 draft review" discussion thread before 5:00 pm on Thursday. As with the previous major project, I'll post video feedback to you individually as quickly as I am able, but peer review is also critical in these early stages. Y'all see stuff that I don't and vice versa!

This draft will most likely be that [shitty first draft](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf) for you, and **that is okay**. Whatever it is, share it with us! The only way to do this wrong is to skip it entirely or turn in a blank document.

WHATEVER YOU DO, JUST TURN SOME CRAP IN PLEASE!

1. As before, it's useful to get organized within your groups and make sure that everyone has at least two people to read their drafts--that way all the feedback doesn't go to two people. Please use your group email, discussions, or whatever group chats you've set up to facilitate that.

2. You can either post your feedback to the forum in a reply to the writer's original post, or you can upload a document with comments inserted. Use whichever method you are most comfortable with.

3. Read each others' fact sheets carefully and generously. Each time you review you should provide <mark>at least two</mark> actionable comments to each writer on any or all of the following areas:
  - Is the writer focused on the right things for this project? Do they talk about examples in specific ways? Do they quote from or summarize appropriate articles, class materials, and other sources?
  - Writing style (how effectively are the writer's sentences, paragraphs, lists, and words explaining their content?)
  - Page design (how effective is the writer's use of white space, overall page alignment, use of color, CRAP principles, and other aspects of page design?)
  - Visual elements (If included, how effective, appropriate, and rhetorical are visual elements?)

A few things to remember about feedback:
1. It's a draft and we're all learning. Be kind.
2. Everyone's learning at different speeds. Be polite.
3. It's still a freaking pandemic outside. Be generous.
4. Take the opportunity to learn from what others are doing. Be attentive.
5. Give feedback to others as you would have feedback given to you.
6. Give writers specific feedback about particular things. This sentence, this word, this picture, this color. Telling writers "It's great you just have to finish" isn't helpful--*they know that already*. Offer specific ideas about how and what to revise or finish.

Peer review is an opportunity to share, learn, and improve your writing. Not participating hurts your final product and the final products of others. Do your group a solid and be present for peer review!! **If you do not post feedback to at least two people in your group, you cannot get full credit for peer review activities, even if you posted a draft on time.**

## Looking Ahead

During [Week 14](week-14-notes) we'll chat about accessibility and professional writing and complete another round of peer review.
