## Facts (?) About Fact Sheets

The “fact sheet” is a recognizable genre, but as with any genre, you can also find plenty of variety. Fact sheets are both [stable and dynamic](https://openenglishatslcc.pressbooks.com/chapter/on-genre/#3). That is, there’s not one “right way” to do a fact sheet, but looking at these lists of features and examples we can get a sense of the **typical features, purposes, audiences, and social actions** for the genre.

### Fact sheets have recurrent style, design, and visual features.

Style features might include things like:

 - Clear and concise language; fact sheets are brief and generally in "lay terms" (words that an average person might understand)
 - Summaries of key information (aka "bottom line up front" or "conclusion-first" writing)
 - “Facts” ([what are facts?](https://writing.colostate.edu/guides/teaching/co300man/pop12d.cfm))
 - Identifying information about the org, such as website, etc.
 - Sometimes, multi-language options ([English and Spanish census](https://www.census.gov/library/fact-sheets/2019/dec/respond-to-2020-census-spanish/respond-to-2020-census-english.html))
 - Citations appear in varying styles
      - [Number-style citations](https://www.aacnnursing.org/News-Information/Fact-Sheets/Nursing-Fact-Sheet) (like many science disciplines)
      - [Bulleted reference list](https://app.box.com/s/139h18adpfu8l18xl13gxwyf2nlk9hku) (like many ed/social/humanities disciplines)
      - [Footnotes or Simple source citation in bottom of second page](https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/US-Prison-Population-Trends-1999-2015.pdf)

Design features might include things like:

 - Often follow a color scheme/design scheme of the organization
 - Subheadings (lots--usually 1 or 2 levels of subdivision)
 - Bold and color for key terms or phrases
 - Bulleted or Numbered lists (lots)
 - Paragraph texts (yep)
 - Single or double-column designs

Visualization or graphics features might include things like:

 - Logo for organization — to let readers know the info is “official” (ethos)
 - Some have text callout boxes for the keyest of key facts, such as “[important considerations](https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_Hurricane_Facts/general_decontamination_fact.pdf)”
 -  Icons - These might be for types of communication, such as [icons  representing a phone, a person, a computer;](https://www.census.gov/library/fact-sheets/2019/dec/2020-census-accessible.html) other fact sheets have icons [representing actions or activities](https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-11/PAG_MYW_OlderAdults_FS.pdf).
    - <mark>(Two resources for icons if you want to use them in your fact sheet: [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) and [Material Design](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline)) </mark>
 - Humanizing pictures of people in activities ([sensory integration, picture of child](https://www.aota.org/-/media/Corporate/Files/AboutOT/Professionals/WhatIsOT/CY/Fact-Sheets/FactSheet_SensoryIntegration.pdf))
 - Pictures and technical illustrations, for example:
    - Pictures identifying objects ([census.gov, what census-takers’ bags and phones should look like)](https://www.census.gov/library/fact-sheets/2020/dec/how-to-identify-a-census-taker.html)
    - Illustrations ([photos of proper footwear and identifying fire ants](https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_Hurricane_Facts/fire_ants.pdf))
    - Process diagram ([the special education cycle](https://app.box.com/s/139h18adpfu8l18xl13gxwyf2nlk9hku))
    - Tables of data ([change in state prison populations](https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/US-Prison-Population-Trends-1999-2015.pdf))
    - Graphs: ([bar charts, other data-oriented visuals](https://criminaljustice.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Supervised-Release-Annual-Scorecard-2019_September-2020.pdf))

### Fact sheets accomplish a range of related actions or purposes (i.e. _exigences_).
- Instruct or inform (safety info; new medical information or research; define key facts about complex medical conditions, safety information; information about an organization’s purpose or processes; [FAQs](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/11/01/myth-vs-fact-caravan))
- Explain how to do something or give instructions (how to go through a process, how to recognize an official census-taker)
- Promote something (a program, an activity)
- Persuade or advocate

### What do these examples show you that you can apply as you’re creating your own fact sheets?

Audience and purpose inform each of these choices and features. Fact sheets for experts differ from fact sheets for parents, families, preprofessionals, publics, decision-makers, laborers, women, people speaking English, people speaking español, and so forth. Fact sheets from medical and public health organizations are stylistically distinct from OSHA and census.gov style sheets--though not as wildly distinct as some genres.
