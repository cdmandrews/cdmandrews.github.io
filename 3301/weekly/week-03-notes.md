# Overview for Week 3

## Ethics and justice and tech. comm.

At the center of technical communication is the idea that technologies and the communication that surrounds them should support human dignity and human rights. Rather than simply concerned with being efficient or easy (yes, those are important), we should be sensitive to the fact that tech comm is **for people** and should be **effective**. It affects people: it can help them or it can hurt them, it can confuse or it can clarify. It can enhance difference or erase it. It can advocate for change, or it can reinforce harmful perspectives and epistemologies.

To read this week:
-  [OTC Chapter 3, Ethics in Technical Communication](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/8b530f4b-5942-4071-845a-0a138601da10). The video in this chapter is definitely worth. your. time. Yes, it's a little longish, and yes it's just slightly dated in one or two areas, but on the whole it's solid. (In 2020, singular "they" is increasingly accepted as an appropriate nongendered usage. Also, the "use African-American/European-American vs use Black/White" topic has moved a bit since this video.) Some important topics in that chapter:
  - ethics: utility, rights, justice, and care
  - consequences of faulty communication
  - appropriate language (or imprecise/biased language)
  - copyright and intellectual property
  - analyzing and presenting data

- Also review [this short resource on ethical presentation of research and data](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/technicalwriting/chapter/9-3-typical-ethics-issues-in-technical-writing/), which includes the following topics:
  - selecting, cherry-picking, and suppressing information
  - presenting visual data ethically
</div>

I'm just gonna put out there right now that I think good tech writing can't be neutral--that it must put people at the center, that it must value human life and dignity, that it can and should encompass cultural difference, that no duh if we're going to be all about audiences than we should take into account native languages and experiences of readers. The fundamental truth of how I've taught TC for years is "you are not your user." That is, the people who are reading/using/affected by your communication are **different** than you, and in all kinds of ways. There is no monoculture; there is no single way of being and doing in the world. That difference is a good thing. And it's also a communication problem for you to resolve--but you never ever do that by making things harder for your audience.

**Burying (Hiding?) important information.** For example, this ICE memo released on July 6 2020 by the US Department of Homeland Security (https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/bcm2007-01.pdf). The memo explains to college administrators that their international (nonimmigrant) students must take either onsite courses or a mix of onsite and online courses in the Fall 2020 semester to remain in the United States. Unfortunately, the memo is generally unclear, burying information in long, dense paragraphs and sentences. Look at the following sentence:
> If a school changes its operational stance mid-semester, and as a result a nonimmigrant student switches to only online classes, or a nonimmigrant student changes their course selections, and as a result, ends up taking an entirely online course load, schools are reminded that nonimmigrant students within the United States are not permitted to take a full course of study through online classes

If you can parse that statement, you'll find a pretty significant policy explanation, considering our experiences in Spring 2020 and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Now look at the memo and try to find that sentence. Burying such a key fact in a long, passive sentence in a long, dense, paragraph in the middle of a long memo raises some serious ethical questions. It's bad enough that it's a cruel policy, but what are the implications of that statement in particular being located where it is? We can't know _why_ it's buried, but we can think about the _effects and implications_ of someone doing it.

**AKA oppression through content prioritization.** Or here's another one. Go to the [DHS ICE website](https://www.ice.gov/) and look at the menu options. Compare the menu in English to the menu en Espa&ntilde;ol. What's changed in one version to the other? What's prioritized in each? Note how numerous content tabs are removed from the Spanish version of the site, including the "Careers" tab. This tab includes career opportunities and other content. What does its complete removal reveal about the goals and perspectives of the organization?


**Audience, justice, ethics.** This week we're opening up our concern with specific audiences and purposes to include justice and ethics, which introduces a number of concerns. It's easy to get into ethics and TPW as a list of do's and don'ts, and I don't only want to do that. What I really like about the chapter you'll read from this week is that it starts by reminding us that ethics is situational and rife with dilemmas: the competing obligations we have to our society, our employer, our profession, our colleagues, our families, and ourselves.

"Utility, rights, justice, and care" are complex. I do encourage you to look at some of the "Sample ethical dilemmas" in the Open TC chapter, as they are good examples of communication situations that might have multiple right answers, or where an answer that's right by one metric is totally wrong by another.

This week's material will also help you begin to look for the different ways faulty, unethical, and unjust communication happens--wether intentionally or unintentionally. For example, think about why [clear communication that emphasizes the main message isn't just just "good health communication" but also "ethical health communication"](https://medium.com/wehearthealthliteracy/reimagining-the-coronavirus-postcard-a42bc87d698f).


## For Tuesday

Participate in the "Communication heroes" discussion forum in your group

 1. While you're letting all that percolate in your brain, write a discussion post in your group's "Communication Heroes" forum:
  - Identify a communication hero and tell the story of someone who supports ethics and social justice through **communicative acts**. This could be someone famous, or someone under the radar; it could be someone you know personally, a teacher, family member, coworker or community member, or it could be someone you have researched and read about. Why are they a communication hero? What lessons can you learn from them? Why is that so important to you?
  - Your post should be no shorter than 250 words, please.

## For Thursday
Writers and professionals of all kinds should consider to whom they have ethical obligations, major types of unethical communication (whether intentional or unintentional), and issues around using copyrighted information in professional organizations.

Just following rules of thumb for good writing is not enough. You've got to think about what you say and how your audience will be affected by it. Sadly, we can read about people communicating unethically, unjustly, or just plain awfully just about every day--and we can see (or worse, experience) the implications of their failure to be ethical.

Participate in the "How NOT to write" discussion forum in your group:

  - Go back through the [chapter on Ethics in Technical Communication]((https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/8b530f4b-5942-4071-845a-0a138601da10) and identify **at least three** specific issues or topics that you see as particularly relevant to your professional goals. Prepare a short slideshow about why you think they are important in the line of work you'd like to take up.
    - Rather than writing loooong unbroken paragraphs on your slides, use a combination of headings, lists, and paragraphs to discuss issues/topics/principles and describe and give examples for each of them in turn. Think about your audience, and use text and slide formatting to emphasize important information. Make your slides easy to read and follow, and use visuals to provide examples or evidence.
  - Close out your slideshow by sharing a link to a recent news story (must be from the last five years) that exemplifies one or more of the ideas you wrote about. Ideally, these should be about a professional in your field, but it's okay if it's not. What dilemmas or obligations did they have to resolve? How did they do so?
    - [How to change the text of your hyperlinks to avoid long and ugly URLs](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/customize-the-text-for-a-hyperlink-63d4fdcc-bce2-41ea-9649-d8aaa900fe2f)
  - In replies to each others' posts, compare notes with your group members.

## Looking ahead

In [week 4](week-04-notes) we'll start our investigation of specific strategies and techniques by which technical and professional writers can make texts usable, readable, effective, and all that other stuff. Ethical. And it all starts with my favorite topic: subheadings.

While we're introducing aspects of document design, you'll also begin a "power searching" course. This is just to help you get used to some advanced search engine strategies you'll need for the first major project, which we'll begin talking about in the weeks to come.
