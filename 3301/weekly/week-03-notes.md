**ethics and justice and tech**  At the center of technical communication is the idea that technologies (and the communication that surrounds them) should support human dignity and human rights. Rather than simply concerned with being efficient or easy (those are important), we should be sensitive to the fact that tech comm is FOR PEOPLE and should be effective. It affects people, it can helps them or it can hurt them, it can confuse or it can clarify. It can enhance difference or erase it. It can advocate for change, or it can reinforce harmful perspectives and epistemologies.

I'm just gonna put out here that I think good tech writing can't be neutral--that it must put people at the center, that it must values human life and dignity, that it can and should encompass cultural difference, that no duh if we're going to be interested in audiences than we should take into account native languages and experiences of readers. The fundamental truth of how I've taught TC for years is "you are not your user" -- that is, they are DIFFERENT than you. That difference is a good thing. And it's also a communication problem for you to resolve--but you never ever do that by making things harder for your audience.

For example, this ICE memo released on July 6 2020 by the US Department of Homeland Security (https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/bcm2007-01.pdf). The memo explains to college administrators that their international (nonimmigrant) students must take either onsite courses or a mix of onsite and online courses in the Fall 2020 semester to remain in the United States. Unfortunately, the memo is generally unclear, burying information in long, dense paragraphs and sentences. Look at the following sentence:
> If a school changes its operational stance mid-semester, and as a result a nonimmigrant student switches to only online classes, or a nonimmigrant student changes their course selections, and as a result, ends up taking an entirely online course load, schools are reminded that nonimmigrant students within the United States are not permitted to take a full course of study through online classes

If you can parse that statement, you'll find a pretty significant policy explanation, considering our experiences in Spring 2020 and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Now look at the memo and try to find that sentence. Burying such a key fact in a long, passive sentence in a long, dense, paragraph in the middle of a long memo raises some serious ethical questions. It's bad enough that it's a cruel policy, but what are the implications of that statement in particular being located where it is?

-- just starting, this will be a part of our work all semester
OTC Chapter 3, Ethics in TC
  -- ethics, bias, justice
  -- copyright
  -- data analysis/presentation
  -- The youtube video in this chapter is lengthy and just slightly dated (see her discussion of "singular/plural they"), but worth. your. time.

  Identify a communication hero and tell the story of someone who supports ethics and social justice through communicative acts. This could be someone famous, or someone under the radar.

## Tuesday
Consider the subtle (and not so subtle) similarities and differences in the rhetorical situation when you offer feedback on Course Experience Surveys vs when you evaluate an instructor on Ratemyprofessor.com.

Identify the differences in the rhetorical situations:

|  | Course Evaluation Survey |	Ratemyprofessor.com |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose |  ??  |  ??  |
| Audience |  ??  |  ??  |
| Writer	|  ??  |  ??  |
| Message	|  ??  |  ??  |
| Context		|  ??  |  ??  |

Now select a piece of workplace writing from this folder (goole drive). Describe and analyze its rhetorical situation, writing a paragraph describing each of the following:
- purpose
- audience (expectations, characteristics, goals, contexts)
- message
- context/culture
[This example of an analysis of a grocery list might be useful as you're working on your own analysis.](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/rhetorical_situation/example3.html)
