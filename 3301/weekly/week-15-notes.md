## Tuesday (draft draft)

Using the same groups as last time (if possible), complete at least one round of peer review for your projects. Remember to share your draft with ME and with your peer reviewers.

Also, some reminders about the reflection memo that you must submit along with your project deliverable:

Reflection is an important component of learning. This memo is a final and intentional opportunity for you to reflect and debrief on the course. It's a chance to connect the dots between what we've done, what we've said, what we've made, and what we've read. 

Write a [memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/format.html), addressed to me. This memo should be 1-2 pages in length. (Think memo format: headers, subject lines, block formatting w/subheadings, opening summary/purpose statements, specific content; make rhetorical choices for type, page design, and other elements.) You have **two major tasks** in this memo:

1. Describe and reflect on your process for developing your project: what you did, what you learned, what was difficult, what successes you had, how you thought about your rhetorical situation, and other issues that seem relevant.
2. Reflect on what youâ€™ve learned about TPW over the last 15 weeks. You might go back and peek at your discussion forum posts from weeks 1, 2, and 8. Talk about what you learned in this class, what you struggled with, and what you succeeded at. How will you apply lessons learned from this course in the future--whether future coursework, careers and the job market, or community work?

You are not required to share you memo as part of peer review, but may wish to if you'd like some feedback from trusted folks in your group.

Turn your memo in with your final project, either as a separate file or as a cover letter in the same file, depending on the style and medium of your project. Yes, you can upload multiple files with a single submission to Blackboard.

## Thursday

You are on Thanksgiving break--rest, eat turkey, finish up projects. Enjoy [this fine set of turkey-themed technical communication](https://cdmandrews.github.io/turkey-techcomm.html).

## Looking ahead

[Next week](week-16-notes) is all finishing up and getting things wrapped up to turn in. Don't forget!
