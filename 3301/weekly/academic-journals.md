# Finding materials in scholarly journals

Don’t start with google.com. Not because Google is bad or evil, but because Google will bring you everything and the kitchen sink and maybe or maybe not the kinds of scholarly, edited, peer-reviewed research studies I (and your other professors) am asking you to turn to.

At the very least, start your search with Google Scholar: [scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/).

Don’t overlook the library databases. The multi-search can be a little intimidating, but with practice you’ll be a pro. I frequently toggle between both Google Scholar and library databases to find precisely the kinds of scholarship I need.

This video introduces how to use the Mary & Jeff Bell Library's multi-search to locate and access research materials:

## Good sources for scholarly, peer-reviewed, or professional-quality research about writing in your field

I recommend starting with the following journals, which publish writing and communication-focused research that frequently intersections with specific disciplinary topics. You can use multi-search or google scholar and search for the journal title and whatever keywords you'd like to use, or just start with your keyword search in Google Scholar and see what you find.
-	*Journal of Business and Technical Communication*
-	*Journal of Technical Writing and Communication*
-	*Written Communication*
-	*Technical Communication*
-	*Technical Communication Quarterly* (usefully, this journal has published a lot about [tactical tech comm](tactical-tech-comm))
-	*Connexions: International Professional Communication Journal*
-	*International Journal of Business Communication*
-	*IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication*
-	*English for Specific Purposes*

You can probably also find a journal that’s specifically about communication in a specialized field or profession:
-	*Communication and Medicine*
-	*Science communication*
-	*Environmental communication*
-	*Journal of health communication*
-	*Journal of communication in healthcare*
