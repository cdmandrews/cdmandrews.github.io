## Tuesday

1. Participate in your group's mid-term discussion forum according to the following prompt:
  1. Watch [&quot;What is Technical Communication&quot;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi5eZ2XLJc4) from Carol Siri Johnson
  2. Read [&quot;Professional and Technical Communication: An Overview&quot;](http://writingcommons.org/professional-and-technical-communication-an-overview) from Writing Commons
  3. So, what exactly is _technical and professional communication_? What definitions of technical and professional communication can you find in the assigned texts, and how do those definitions help you think about what we've studied already? Finally, how do the ideas, concepts, and strategies we've discussed from TPC connect to the sort of writing you foresee you'll be doing in your own professional field someday, whether that's in the criminal justice system, freelance writing, environmental science, or physical therapy? Along with your textbook and the texts I've listed above, find one other source (from our library, in a scholarly journal, or another formal source) that provides a definition or explanation of technical communication/technical and professional writing.
  5. Your post should be at least  **300**  words long and make  **specific references**  to the assigned texts (including quotations and some form of in-text citation).
  6. As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.
  7. **Be sure to reply and respond to your group member&#39;s posts over the course of the week. How did you understand these different definitions?**
