# Notes and Overview for Week 7
[ENGL 3301, Fall 2021](../calendar.html)

We are continuing our focus on **writing style** this week, with a particular focus on style and structure. Style is the way you express your ideas in a document, from the paragraph level to sentence structure and the words and phrases you use. Style is different from correctness, which has to do with squeaky-clean grammar, mechanics, and spelling. As your reading this week will point out, style guidelines ([such as the 7Cs](the-7cs)) can conflict with each other, and there are always tradeoffs. **As a writer, you need to be able to notice different styles when you see them and make decisions about when to use a particular style or not**.

You also are working on your fact sheets this week, and we will have our first peer review session for those. You'll need a [rough draft of your fact sheet about writing in your profession for project 1 ready by Thursday](../project-1). More details on that below.

<mark>Assigned to read this week</mark>
- [BLUF: The military standard that can make your writing more powerful](https://www.animalz.co/blog/bottom-line-up-front/) Bottom-line up front, aka Conclusions-first is a powerful approach for many kinds of professional writing.
- [The bite, the snack, and the meal](https://ewriteonline.com/bite-snack-and-meal-how-to-feed-content-hungry-site-visitors/) is an approach to web content writing that you will find useful more broadly in your professional writing, as it emphasizes making your key message clear in three "sizes."
- [Effective rhetoric, effective writing: Parallelism in technical communication](https://helenfawcett.com/effective-rhetoric-effective-writing-parallelism-in-technical-communication/) introduces parallelism at the sentence level.
- Revisit [Subheadings: Perhaps the most useful technique in technical writing](https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/08/23/subheadings-perhaps-the-most-useful-technique-in-technical-writing/) is an excellent article about subheadings that also actually practices what it preaches.
- Revisit chapter [3.2 Headings](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/headings/)

## For Tuesday

<em>Like previous weeks, this assignment is individual and not in the forums. For this assignment and the next few Tuesdays, you will revise different aspects of your "Professional sites and resources memo" from Week 5. </em>

1. After reading this week's materials on key messages, style, and parallelism, **revisit and revise the language** in your "Professional sites and resources" memo from the previous weeks. You are free to rewrite your memo however you like, but should specifically try to enact the following in your memo:
  - "Bottom line up front" or "bite, snack, meal" writing
  - Key messages in headings and subheadings
  - Parallel structure in headings, lists, sentences, and elsewhere as needed

2. You should also incorporate changes based on last week's feedback. We will incorporate visuals and other elements into your memo in the weeks to come.

2. Post your redesigned memo to the "Elements 4" assignment in Blackboard. Upload your text as a Word document or PDF.

3. In the "comments" with your submission, reflect briefly on the assignment, explaining why you changed what you changed and what difficulties or successes you had.

## For Thursday

post a draft. get and give feedbacks.
