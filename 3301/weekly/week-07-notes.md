# Notes and Overview for Week 7


## Wait, back up: What is professional and technical writing, again?

This week marks the end of the first unit of the course. In Weeks 1 through 6, you've gotten a rapid-fire introduction to primary strategies, elements, and approaches to technical and professional writing. It was quick and messy, I know!

Through the next two units of the course, we'll return to these ideas, refine them and look at examples in your fields in order to help you put them into action.

This week, we will read, think, and write broadly about what technical and professional writing/communication is all about and how some of the things you've learned thus far apply to the kinds of writing you see yourself doing 'out there' in the professional world.

# For Tuesday

As you'll remember from [the syllabus](../index.html), there's no mid-term exam in the course. This week's discussion is worth more points than your regular weekly discussions and activities, so bring your best efforts to bear.

Participate in your group's mid-term discussion forum according to the following prompt:

  1. Aside from your textbook readings and the required texts I've listed above, find one other source (from our library, in a scholarly journal, or another reputable source) that provides a definition or explanation of technical and professional writing or technical communication.

  2. So, what exactly is _technical and professional writing/communication_? What definitions of technical and professional communication can you find in the assigned texts, and how do those definitions help you think about what we've studied so far in this course?

  3. How do the ideas, concepts, and strategies we've discussed from TPW connect to the sort of writing you foresee you'll be doing in your own professional field someday, whether that's in the criminal justice system, freelance writing, government work, environmental science, physical therapy, or something else? OR, if you are thinking of being a professional technical writer, what seem to be the most important parts of those definitions to you? How do they help you understand the kinds of work you might do and the skills you might need to develop?

Criteria for success:
  3. Your post should be **at least 300 words long**. Do not count long quotes from readings toward your total word count.
  4. Your post should make  **specific references**  to the assigned texts (including quotations and some form of in-text citation).
  4. Please **practice your 7Cs** as you revise and refine your work. Your post should be a little more polished than normal. Use things like paragraphs, headings and subheadings, lists, document design elements such as colored/bold/italic typefaces, and even tables or graphics to develop your ideas if they're rhetorically appropriate.
  6. As with all discussion forum assignments, it's easier for everyone if you post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. However, if you really want to protect your formatting you can upload a document this week.
  7. **Reply and respond to 3-4 your fellow group member&#39;s posts over the course of the week. Have a conversation. How did you understand these different definitions? What insights can you bring to bear?**

#  For Thursday

There's nothing due today. Take a break, take a nap, work on something for another course, or get some early work and thinking done on the [first major project for this course](../project-1).

#  Looking ahead

I will update this with information about Week 08 soon. Read the description for the [first major project](../project-1), and start a list of questions you have about what I'm asking you to do.

Before you do anything else, your group needs to do two things. There's a "Group A Whatever forum" in your group area, and you can deliberate there if you don't have another means of communication you're using.

**Task 1**: Pick a group name. Rather than having myself pick dumb names for each group, I'd like you to select a name for yourselves. (Because honestly, once it gets out that a group got named "House Stark" you'd all know I'm playing favorites!) Pick whatever kind of name you like; ideally, one that fits the particular character or makeup of your group. My only constraints are that 1) everyone agree, and 2) your group's name begin with the letter that's already used to identify your group (Group A, B, C, D, or E.)

**Task 2**. Elect or select a **coordinator**. This is a light duty job, but best suited to people who 1) aren't afraid to email folks,  2) usually post assignments early rather than later in the week, and 3) are very good at self-starting. The coordinator will have a specific job helping the group get organized on weekly assignments in weeks to come (starting Week 08) as we shift to some different kinds of collaboration.
