# Tuesday

1. Participate in your group's mid-term discussion forum according to the following prompt:

  3. Aside from your textbook readings and the texts I've listed above, find one other source (from our library, in a scholarly journal, or another formal source) that provides a definition or explanation of technical communication/technical and professional writing.
  3. So, what exactly is _technical and professional writing/communication_? What definitions of technical and professional communication can you find in the assigned texts, and how do those definitions help you think about what we've studied so far in this course? How do the ideas, concepts, and strategies we've discussed from TPW connect to the sort of writing you foresee you'll be doing in your own professional field someday, whether that's in the criminal justice system, freelance writing, government work, environmental science, physical therapy, or something else? OR, if you are thinking of being a professional technical writer, what seem to be the most important parts of those definitions to you? How do they help you understand the kinds of work you might do and the skills you might need to develop?
  5. Your post should be at least  **300**  words long and make  **specific references**  to the assigned texts (including quotations and some form of in-text citation).
  6. As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.
  7. **Be sure to reply and respond to your group member&#39;s posts over the course of the week. How did you understand these different definitions?**
