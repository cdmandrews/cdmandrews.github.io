# Notes and Overview for Week 14
[ENGL 3301, Fall 2021](../calendar.html)

Let's just finish up those final projects, eh!

**Check back in this space on Monday or Tuesday for updates**; I'll post a "here's what I saw" video reviewing what I saw in everyone's drafts and give you some general feedback that I think most folks will find useful. Otherwise, keep writing.

## For Tuesday

Nothing. Work on your report. Schedule an appointment with me. Eat healthy.

## For Thursday

Post a revised, updated draft of your project for peer and instructor review to your group's "14.2: Another project 2 draft review" discussion forum. Same deal as last time: provide some **actionable** suggestions, and I will post video feedback as well.

## Looking ahead

[Week 15](week-15-notes) is when we turn in project 2. I will also go over the reflective portfolio that you'll turn in for finals week.
