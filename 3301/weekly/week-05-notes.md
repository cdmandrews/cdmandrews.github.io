# Overview for Week 5

## Tech writing style: Who's kicking whom?

> Langauge changes over time. It always has. Our expectations of appropriate style also change over time. They always have.

This week is about style: the way you express your ideas in a document, from the paragraph level to sentence structure and the words and phrases you use. **Style** is different from **correctness**, which has to do with squeaky-clean grammar, mechanics, and spelling. As your reading this week will point out, style guidelines (such as the 7Cs) can conflict with each other, and there are always tradeoffs. You need to be able to **notice** different styles when you see them and **make decisions** about when to use a particular style or not.

Oh by the way, this ain't a grammar course. I ain't fixin' your grammar for fifteen weeks. What I'd really like to focus us on this week&mdash;and beyond&mdash;is how we make choices with our words and sentences and the implications of those choices. What's style got to do with audience? Purpose? Context? And what the heck does **clear** mean?

The messy thing about style is that there are LOTS of rules, but those rules are bound up in context, purpose, and audience. The answer to everything in this course is rhetoric: what's going to work best for my particular readers in their particular situations in their particular use-contexts? Write thusly.

- [TWE Chapter 2: Professional Style](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/part/style/) overviews the usual sorts of style issues in technical writing:
  - [2.1 Reader-Centered Writing](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/readercentred/)
  - [2.2 Communicating with Precision](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/communicatingprecision/)
  - [2.3 Writing to Persuade](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/writingpersuade/)

- [TWE Chapter 3.5 Style tips: Revising to Enhance Readability](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/styletipsreadability/) is a good checklist to come back to.


### Writer- and Reader-centered style

Whenever possible, write so that busy people understand what you are saying the first time they read it. You don't have to snazz it up; help your reader's valuable attention by focusing your sentences on the most important thing. Keep things simple! One way writers can do this is by using reader-centered messages that make clear how the message will affect readers. Reader-focused writers look at the situation from the reader's point of view and adjust content, structure, and tone to meet their needs.

Reader-centered messages use the pronoun "you" to center the message on the reader, while writer-centered messages rely on "I" and "we." Reader-centered messages use what's called a **"you attitude"**. To write with a "you attitude":
1. Focus on what the reader needs and values
2. In neutral or positive situations, use reader-focused pronouns (you)
3. Avoid discussing your own feelings
4. Refer to specific, relevant information

Three short examples showing the difference between writer-centered and reader-centered statements:
>  "I have worked hard to get you the best contract possible."

In this first  example the writer emphasizes how they worked rather than the benefits that the reader will receive. Sure, it's nice that they worked hard, but that's not really the important message. See also letters saying "We are excited to inform you that..." Some common email phrases that discuss your own feelings instead of getting to the point include "I was wondering if it would be okay if I could..." and "I just wanted to let you know..." It's okay to get to the question.

> "You'll be happy to learn that we're ready to offer you the best contract possible."

In the second example, the writer begins by telling the reader how to feel. And *nobody tells me how to feel*!

> "Under the new contract you'll receive dental insurance."

This third sentence starts with the important information&mdash;the new contract&mdash;and gives specific, relevant details about it. You get dental now. Consider the difference between everyone's favorite Amazon email: "We shipped your order today" versus "Your order will arrive on Thursday." Which sentence works better for the person watching out for porch pirates?

For negative situations, writer-centered messages prove more effective than reader-centered messages because negative reader-centered messages can trigger defensive responses. For instance, “*You need to send us your overdue balance of $550 or we'll probably take you to court*” will likely cause a negative reaction. Compare that to: “*Please pay the overdue balance of $550 to avoid possible legal actions. If you need help making this payment, please contact our credit department for assistance*."  

Along with using "you", writers can also be reader-centered by writing in a conversational tone rather than a stiff, legalistic one: "*The changes agreed upon per our conversation are herein included.*" is exceedingly formal and doesn't really sound like it's written for human consumption. On the other hand, "*The changes included here were the ones we discussed during our telephone conversations*" sounds like there's a person on the other end of the line.


### Style and inclusive language
<sub>(This article contains material adapted from [Intro to Professional Communications](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/professionalcomms/chapter/4-3-inclusive-language/), CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)</sub>

Good&mdash;ethical, just, human, awesome&mdash;communicators write inclusively and don't make assumptions about their readers. We think about our readers, question our initial assumptions, and write about them in ways that don't reinforce negative stereotypes.

 Some simple ways to write inclusively:
 - Use the singular "they" instead of "he or she." For example, instead of saying, “A communicator should understand his or her audience,” you could say, “A communicator should understand their audience” or “Communicators should understand their audience.” People have been arguing over this one for a while now in the vicious gender-neutral language wars, but it's enjoyed a spendid revival since the 90s. The usage has [a long history (at least since Middle English)](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/), the controversy is old and tired, (at least since the 18th century), and in general singular "they" has seen increased usage since the 1970s. Mostly because people don't notice it unless it's pointed out to them.
 - Be specific when discussing a person's identity and use the terminology they prefer. (Basically, this is the "don't be a jerk" clause.) There is considerable debate ongoing about person-first and identity-first language right now: the difference between the person-first option "person with autism" and identity-first option "autistic person." Neither is right or wrong; instead, this is about how people see themselves in the world; is disability a characteristic of a person's identity, or a secondary attribute? When in doubt, ask the person what terminology they prefer.
 - Question the assumptions that you make about your audience. The monoculture is dead. Consider that many of your readers might not share the same cultural values, experiences, or television shows. For example, a sentence like “Every child waits all year for Christmas morning,” consider that many of your readers might not have shared this experience. Your mainstream 1990's sitcom references are now officially obscure cultural references. Don't assume.

### The 7Cs and style at work.

Style is important because, as you've been learning, people aren't paid to read your documents. They're paid to work. This work often involves reading things, but that's not the primary focus of most jobs. When you place important information at the beginning of a document rather than the end and when you create short, information-rich paragraphs with clear, active sentence structures and jargon-less prose, you help readers understand and act on information safely and efficiently.

I won't go into the 7Cs at length here&mdash;[that's what the textbook is for](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/communicatingprecision/). But I'll add the list here so you can have a quick reference to it. Communication needs to be:
- Clear
- Coherent
- Concise
- Concrete
- Correct
- Complete
- Courteous

One more time for the people in the back: the basic principles of effective style listed in your readings are all about readers. While correctness is important, using a style that is understandable and conventional for readers and will help them meet their goals is critical.

# Tuesday

Participate in the "Make it plain" discussion forum in your group. You've got a two-part task this time out:

- Write reflectively in response to this week's readings:  What is a "professional style"? What does it look like, sound like, feel like? What did you think that phrase meant six weeks ago (if you thought about it all)? What do you think that means for you today?

- Choose ten concepts, technical terms, processes, acronyms, or jargon from your major.
  - List your ten terms, along with definitions that would be appropriate for a professional or academic in that field.
  - Then write a one- to three-sentence definition for each term that explains it in plain language.  (Plain language examples to get you started: [Coronavirus Plain Language Glossary](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/common/Words-To-Know-About-the-Coronavirus-in-Plain-Language.pdf), [COVID-19 in Plain Language](https://ilny.us/phocadownload/covid-19-plain-language-flyer-with-facemask.pdf))
- In your groups, discuss, share strategies, reflect on assigned readings, and talk out what you noticed this week.


# Thursday

A big part of the major projects in this course is locating information about and examples of technical and professional writing in your field. ([This is a good time to look at the first major project description if you haven't already](./project-1.md)) To help you do this, we'll develop and practice some advanced internet research skills. Over the next two weeks, you'll take this short [Power Searching with Google](https://coursebuilder.withgoogle.com/sample/course) course.

For this Thursday, complete at least the following parts of the Power Searching course:
  - Complete the pre-course assessment
  - Complete Units 1, 2, and 3. Do all unit activities except for the embedded discussion forum posts.
  - Complete the Mid-course assessment
  - Take a screenshot of your mid-course assessment when you have successfully completed it.

Finish the Power Searching 1 assignment in the Week 05 folder.
  1. Summarize what you have learned about power searching. (No shorter than 150 words) What new information about searching the internet did you pick up, and what skills did you add to your toolbox? How did you think your search skills were before taking the power searching course, and how do they match up now?
  2. Post the screenshot of your mid-course assessment.
