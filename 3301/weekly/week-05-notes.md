# Overview for Week 5

## Tech writing style

This week is about style: the way you express your ideas in a document, from the paragraph level to sentence structure and the words and phrases you use. **Style** is different from **correctness**, which has to do with squeaky-clean grammar, mechanics, and spelling.

Style is important because, as you've been learning, people aren't paid to read your documents. They're paid to work. This work often involves reading things, but that's not the primary focus of most jobs. When you place important information at the beginning of a document rather than the end and when you create short, information-rich paragraphs with clear, active sentence structures and jargon-less prose, you help readers understand and act on information safely and efficiently.

Note that the basic principles of effective style listed in your readings are all about readers. While correctness is important, using a style that is understandable and conventional for readers and will help them meet their goals is critical.

Many beginning technical or workplace writers mistake concision with brevity; read about distinctions between the two **link to text**. While you want to communicate clearly without wasting your readers' time, you still must communicate completely and ensure readers have everything they need to be informed, make decisions, and take actions.

A lot of writers get hung up on grammar. These issues are important for writers to master, but I don't believe you have to be a master of grammatical terminology to be a good writer. The best things to do about these issues? Here's my list:

- Don't avoid writing: practice as much as you can.
- Think about your audience and make stylistic decisions based on what you know about them.
- Get a trusted colleague or supervisor to give your documents a quick once-over before you pass them along (you might be lucky enough to have an editor on staff)
- Know your weak spots and have references at hand to help you work on them.
- There are many good references for style, grammar, spelling, and mechanics on the internet. Two sources I refer students to often are:
  - Purdue Online Writing Lab: Searchable exercises and resources for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and style
  - Common grammar and usage problems
  - Spelling problems
  - Power revision techniques
