# Overview for Week 5

TWE: Style tips (https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/styletipsreadability/)

## Tech writing style

This week is about style: the way you express your ideas in a document, from the paragraph level to sentence structure and the words and phrases you use. **Style** is different from **correctness**, which has to do with squeaky-clean grammar, mechanics, and spelling.

### Writer-centered Style

### Reader-centered style

### 7 Cs

Style is important because, as you've been learning, people aren't paid to read your documents. They're paid to work. This work often involves reading things, but that's not the primary focus of most jobs. When you place important information at the beginning of a document rather than the end and when you create short, information-rich paragraphs with clear, active sentence structures and jargon-less prose, you help readers understand and act on information safely and efficiently.

Note that the basic principles of effective style listed in your readings are all about readers. While correctness is important, using a style that is understandable and conventional for readers and will help them meet their goals is critical.

Many beginning technical or workplace writers mistake concision with brevity; read about distinctions between the two **link to text**. While you want to communicate clearly without wasting your readers' time, you still must communicate completely and ensure readers have everything they need to be informed, make decisions, and take actions.

A lot of writers get hung up on grammar. These issues are important for writers to master, but I don't believe you have to be a master of grammatical terminology to be a good writer. The best things to do about these issues? Here's my list:

- Don't avoid writing: practice as much as you can.
- Think about your audience and make stylistic decisions based on what you know about them.
- Get a trusted colleague or supervisor to give your documents a quick once-over before you pass them along (you might be lucky enough to have an editor on staff)
- Know your weak spots and have references at hand to help you work on them.
- There are many good references for style, grammar, spelling, and mechanics on the internet. Two sources I refer students to often are:
  - Purdue Online Writing Lab: Searchable exercises and resources for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and style
  - Common grammar and usage problems
  - Spelling problems
  - Power revision techniques

# Tuesday

# Thursday

A big part of the major projects in this course is locating information about and examples of technical and professional writing in your field. ([This is a good time to look at the first major project description if you haven't already](./project-1.md)) To help you do this, we'll develop and practice some advanced internet research skills. Over the next two weeks, you'll take this short [Power Searching with Google](https://coursebuilder.withgoogle.com/sample/course) course.

For this Thursday, complete at least the following parts of the Power Searching course:
  - Complete the pre-course assessment
  - Complete Units 1, 2, and 3. Do all unit activities except for the embedded discussion forum posts.
  - Complete the Mid-course assessment
  - Take a screenshot of your mid-course assessment when you have successfully completed it.

Finish the Power Searching 1 assignment in the week 05 folder.
  1. Summarize what you have learned about power searching. (No shorter than 150 words) What new information about searching the internet did you pick up, and what skills did you add to your toolbox? How did you think your search skills were before taking the power searching course, and how do they match up now?
  2. Post the screenshot of your mid-course assessment.
