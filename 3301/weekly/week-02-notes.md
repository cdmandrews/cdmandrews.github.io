[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

# Notes and Overview for Week 2

For this week, we're continuing our general introduction to TPW, especially focusing on [audience](https://writingcommons.org/section/information-literacy/information/consider-your-audience/) and [exigence/purpose](https://writingcommons.org/section/rhetoric/rhetorical-situation/purpose/). These concepts are important, and we'll come back to them again and again for the entire semester. We'll also spend time talking about correspondence [genres](https://writingcommons.org/section/genre/), especially email and memos.

## Audiences and TPW

"**Know your audience**" and "**You are not your audience**" are important points to wrap your brains around. Audience analysis is the process of figuring out who your audience is so you can write to their needs rather than your own. Remember: technical communication addresses **particular readers** and **helps those readers solve problems**. Getting out of your own head and into an audience's head is HARD, and is something we'll practice a. lot. this semester.

Two big audience-related myths (overgeneralizations, really) that TPW students can sometimes trip over are *dumb audiences* and *general audiences*:

### Dumb Audiences, aka "Uncle Steve"

I have this imaginary (slightly based in reality) figure I use as an example in lectures sometimes named "Uncle Steve." Every family has an Uncle Steve--that person that needs things explained to them five times and still doesn't quite understand (and maybe doesn't want to). The dude who always derails your Facebook or Instagram comments with some irrelevant stuff about "kids these days don't know how to whatever anymore..." Uncle Steve is nice enough, and you love him, but he kind of always misses the point.

Occasionally in professional and technical writing texts or articles you'll see guidance to "[explain it to me like I'm five](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/)," which assumes that all technical writing is about making really complex things sensible to people with zero knowledge of the subject.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/27060669" width="640" height="361" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/27060669">The Office - LI5 Surplus</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user1472744">Ryan Faucett</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

Unfortunately, that's often not true. In fact, that viewpoint is a one-dimensional and super-condescending way of looking at professional and technical writing. Doing audience analysis is NOT about assuming your audience is dumber than you. (Put yourself in the reverse position--do you want everyone assuming you're the dumb one? Nope.) Instead, audience analysis is about considering what your readers know already, what they need to know, and how they need to know it. If you write like a 6th-grader to a Ph.D. or a small-business owner, you're going to make someone mad. Figure out who the specific kind of person is on the other end of your communication and write to them (user experience and web designers use something called [personas](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html)).  

The _Plain Language Act_ website has two great short resources on addressing audiences: [Do your research](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/audience/do-your-research/) and  [Address the user](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/audience/address-the-user/).

### General audiences, aka "The public"

The lazy person’s answer to “who’s your audience?” on social media and lots of government or organizational communication is “the general public.” That is wrong.  Here's a solid essay on the topic if you want to read someone other than me say it: [There is No General Public: Starting with Audience for Stronger Science Communication Plans](https://medium.com/science-communication-media/there-is-no-general-public-starting-with-audience-for-stronger-science-communication-plans-6603a81da8d6)

One more time for the people in the back: "The general public" is not your audience.

Certainly, in a lot of cases anybody will be able to see and access your stuff. That’s among the default implications of rhetorical velocity and social media as a delivery system and public access to information in a transparent democratic republic. But really we should be talking about publics and groups: audiences rather than some generic “the public." **Audiences are people who need or will work with your content, and are those folks whom your content is designed specifically for.** That [publicly available government web page about victim impact statements](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ak/victim-impact-statements) uses "you" and "your" in its language, and that pronoun is directed to very specific people: victims of a crime. That's substantially different from "the general public" because the audience in that case has specific tasks to do, specific knowledge to rely on and knowledge they don't have, and specific goals or problems to solve. Similarly, the Corpus Christi Independent School District (CCISD) Facebook page might be out there on social media for anyone and their aunt to see, but their audience is specifically the CCISD community of parents, administration and staff, and students.

Even though "the public" might have access to your document, that doesn't mean your document's audience is the public. The public is a **stakeholder** in many federal, state, and municipal communications--that's why we have access, because it affects us and we should be able to see how our federal, state, and local governments function to a reasonable extent. But **the audience--the people for whose use a text is purposefully written**--is different. In the case of a police report, for example, there are really three audiences who are going to use/read the document in different ways:
1. The supervisor, who is looking for incorrect grammar, missing details, incorrect facts/notations, and unclear narratives. Mostly wants to make sure the document is tight for CYA
2. The district attorney/prosecutor, who doesn't care about grammar or how well the officer presents himself or herself; the DA is looking to determine if the suspect should be charged and prosecuted and is thus looking for details that will correspond with legal statutes.
3. The defense attorney, who wants to derail the whole thing and looks for errors, missing information, contradictions, grammar errors that lead to confusion, and unethical or nonstandard police behaviors in the report.

Notice who's not in the list: **people who the report is about** (i.e. suspects, victims, or people involved in the reported incident) and **the public**. Both groups do have a relative stake in a police report, but in most cases the report acts as a record that the person can obtain rather than a document that's written to them. Because it is about them, because they have a right to documentation that's about them, or because they have a vested interest in the outcome, they are a stakeholder, but not an audience. If you've ever gotten a traffic citation, on the other hand, it likely has instructions for how to handle the citation, where to pay a fine, what website or municipality you need to report to, and that sort of thing. For that stuff, you're most definitely the audience. But in that case, you're no longer "the public"--you're a specific audience "person who has received a citation", one with a different set of needs, goals, attitudes, and experiences from some general public.

> <sub>The above information comes from Leslie Seawright's fine 2012 dissertation, "[The Literacy Practices of Law Enforcement](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1294&context=etd)". She published this research in 2017 as [_Genres of Power_](https://www.amazon.com/Genre-Power-Writers-Readers-Rhetoric/dp/0814118429)</sub>

**Some examples of distinguishing between audiences:**
- Look at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Guide to Writing for Social Media, appendix A](https://www.cdc.gov/socialmedia/tools/guidelines/pdf/GuidetoWritingforSocialMedia.pdf). See chapter 2 to read about how the CDC segments their audience and the roles they segment their audience into.
- Another breakdown of audiences is over at the World Health Organization (WHO). See [“Goals and key audiences”](https://www.who.int/about/communications/goal-and-key-audiences)
and how they segment their audience into some specific roles.

## Purpose, or Doing stuff with writing.

Now hold on a second and back up to that list of readers for the police report. Not only did that one teensy little narrative have three different audiences, but each of those audiences had an entirely different reason for using the police report. So, when we're talking about TPW, not only do texts frequently have multiple different audiences, those audiences probably have different needs and purposes.

### Multiple audiences, multiple purposes, multiple aaaack.

Let's break our police report example down in a table:

| Audiences of a police report | and their purpose for reading that report |
| --- | --- |
| The officer's supervisor | Reviews and collaborates (via editing or requesting revisions) to ensure document is complete, correct, and clear; wants document to represent department well. |
| The district attorney or prosecutor | Reviews for details related to chargeable and prosecutable offenses; looks for details so they can make a decision and build a strong case. |
| The defense attorney | Reviews for errors, gaps, problems; wants to find problems with the report that undermine its or the officer's authority. |

Another example: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigates civil aviation, highway, marine, and other kinds of accidents. Their goal is to collect and record facts and determine probable cause, but the NTSB isn't regulatory). Part of their process is generating lots and lots of reports. NTSB accident report audiences are broadly summarized as "anyone who can affect change to improve transportation safety" ([NTSB style guide 1-3](https://www.governmentattic.org/30docs/NTSBwritigGuides_2014_2000.pdf)), but that includes a diverse bunch of people with different needs: Congress, Government transportation agencies, industry officials, and the news media.

**Purpose refers to why writers are writing, but it also has to do with why audiences are reading**. So, with your writing, you might have generic purposes like documenting or creating a record, giving or requesting information, coordinating resources, justifying a decision, or persuading someone. Now think about audiences' different purposes for reading: are they trying learn something new? make a decision? implement a course of action? advise someone else? select from different options? What are they going to DO with what you've written?

I can remember lots of times in school or college where I mostly just sat at a blinking computer screen thinking "Why do I have to write this?" In school, mostly the purpose for writing is to display your knowledge or mastery and to get a good grade. The audience (your teacher) already knows the material or at least the method involved, and wants you to show them that you know what they say you should know, and that you know that they know you know. With workplace writing, proving your brilliance generally ain't the point. Your purpose is all about getting sh** done or helping other people get their sh** done.

### Explicit purpose statements

As a writer, a clear sense of purpose can inform your invention and writing process, and can help you make choices about genre and style. If you have a clear sense for why you're writing and what you're trying to accomplish with it, you'll be able to make lots of decisions along the way about what to include or leave out, what voice or tone to use, or how much you have to explain about your graphs and tables. (And that's all stuff we'll talk about through the semester.)

As a reader, being able to determine the purpose of a document can help you know what to do with it and whether or not it's relevant to your needs. A clear title, subject line, or introduction helps you understand the text's subject, why you should read it, and what you need to do with it. Sometimes a purpose becomes so inherent and repeated in an organization that it becomes presumed as part of a genre's reason for being and doesn't have to be stated anymore. That's why things like syllabi, resumes, and product manuals don't always have purpose statements. But you'll see from examples throughout the semester that explicit statements of purpose are common in many professional and technical genres. Some examples:

| Example | Purpose statement from the text
| --- | --- |
| [How-to article, installing window unit A/Cs](https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a6030/how-to-install-a-window-air-conditioner/) | "Here, I’ll share some tips on what to consider when buying an air conditioner, and then how to install it securely and remove it for winter storage." |
| [NOAA Service Assessment report, Hurricane Katrina](https://www.weather.gov/media/publications/assessments/Katrina.pdf) | "This report provides specific recommendations and highlights best practices to be applied to NWS operations in future hazardous events." |
| [OSHA Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3990.pdf) | "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) developed this COVID-19 planning guidance based on traditional infection prevention and industrial hygiene practices. It focuses on the need for employers to implement engineering, administrative, and work practice controls and personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as considerations for doing so. This guidance is intended for planning purposes. Employers and workers should use this planning guidance to help identify risk levels in workplace settings and to determine any appropriate control measures to implement." |

Not every document has an explicit statement of purpose, but once you start looking for them you'll start seeing them all over the place. Some of your teachers might frown on this kind of purpose statement, but this class is a safe space for you to try them out. I encourage you to start drafting with some version of the following; doing so will help you clarify what you're trying to do early on when purpose can be kind of nebulous:
- The purpose of this memo is to ...
- In this report, I will ...
- This fact sheet ...

You'll also sometimes see introductions (such as the OSHA example in the table above) that clarify purpose and audience at the same time. These statements help readers decide whether a document is relevant to their needs and if they should read it or not:
- This design specification is for test engineers supporting Project Frambus.
- This guide explains how to train a AlienWarez model, and how to serve the model in production.

Even if it feels a little training wheels-ish at first, that's okay; you can always revise those statements into something more appropriate for your audience in a later draft. I won't talk about them here, but titles and subject lines are other key spaces where we can pick up information about audience and purpose.


# For Tuesday

Complete the "Introduction to Tech Writing" discussion forum in your group

1. Find three examples of what you consider technical and professional writing. These might be correspondence, journal articles, lab reports, manuals, web pages, advertisements, or something else you consider to be TPW. You can use things you find online or that are lying around your home or workplace. Take a picture or screenshot, download a file, or get a link for each example.
2. Add your links or pictures into a PowerPoint or Google slideshow. Share your examples and on each slide discuss how your documents reflect some of the conventions and characteristics of technical writing you read about in this week's readings. Quote relevant passages from our reading assignments in your slideshow. If you can, identify the specific audience(s) and purpose(s) for each example. Depending on your comments, you'll probably have at least six content slides and a title slide.
3. Look at your peers' slideshows; post replies in to their post that compare findings, comment on each others' examples, and discuss some of the differences between TPW and academic, journalistic, and other kinds of writing you're familiar with.

# For Thursday

Complete the "Email for dummies" discussion forum in your group

1. Search the internet for at least three advice or how-to articles on workplace or professional email. (There are lots! Here's a starter for you, from the [Heroic Technical Writing blog](https://heroictechwriting.com/2011/12/20/using-the-tools-effectively)).
1. Write a post in your group's "Email for Dummies" forum in which you do the following:
  - List links and titles for your three articles, and write a 50-word summary for each one.
  - Discuss some of what you think are the most important **principles** for work email you read about in those three articles and your textbook chapters. These could be style tips as well as workplace culture tips like how frequently to check email or when to do email, or even reflections on gender, culture, and style.
  - Describe a recent example of an email you sent that either succeeds or fails by those principles. If it was great, explain specifically why it was; if it wasn't, explain how you might have done better in that situation.
  - Quote relevant passages from our reading assignments in your post and connect your examples and summaries to ideas about audience and purpose.

# Looking ahead

In [week 3](week-03-notes) we'll continue exploring audience and turn to focus specifically on social justice and ethics. Spoilers: [professional and technical writing should not be used to exploit, repress, or oppress human beings](https://attw.org/blog/the-just-use-of-imagination-a-call-to-action/).

The topic is charged, especially right now, and always runs the risk of getting a little prickly. Though we don't normally have real explosions or problems in the discussion forums in this class, I will take this moment to remind everyone about the syllabus' "Statement of Civility":

>Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi has a diverse student population that represents the population of the state. Our goal is to provide you with a high quality educational experience that is free from repression. You are responsible for following the rules of the University, city, state and federal government. We expect that you will behave in a manner that is dignified, respectful and courteous to all people, regardless of sex, ethnic/racial origin, religious background, sexual orientation or disability. Behaviors that infringe on the rights of another individual will not be tolerated.

This statement does not mean "don't disagree," but it does mean that we all expect our backgrounds, identities, and personhoods to be respected; name-calling, threats, and angry flaming are all unacceptable.
