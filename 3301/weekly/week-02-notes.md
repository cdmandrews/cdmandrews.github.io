# Overview for Week 2

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

## Big picture
Introduction to TPW: readers, exigencies, and genres

- Review OTC Chapter 1 (we read it last week)
- TWE Chapter 1: What is Technical Communication?
- TWE Chapter 1.2: Conventions and Characteristics

Two genres we'll come back to because they're just so everyday: memos and emails
- TWE 7.1 "Correspondence" https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/correspondence/ Briefly describes guidelines and format for email, memo, and other workplace format

- OTC 2.13: Memos and Emails https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/ae63b0b2-c5f8-4747-bd36-365f68a55c77 Digs into culture and convention around correspondence formats

Correspondence video: you attitiude and etc.

## Tuesday
Post an example in the forums. Explain what makes it PTW--who's the specific audience, what purpose(s) does it have?

## Thursday
Search the internet for at least three advice or how-to articles on workplace or professional email. (There are lots! Here's a starter for you, from the [Heroic Technical Writing blog](https://heroictechwriting.com/2011/12/20/using-the-tools-effectively)). Provide links to each article, and write a 50-word summary for each article's content.

Then summarize, connect, and reflect:
- What are some of the most important **principles** for work email you read about in those three articles and your textbook chapters?? These could be style tips as well as workplace culture tips like how frequently to check email, when to do email, etcetera.
- Describe a recent example of an email you sent that either succeeds or fails by those principles.
- Quote relevant passages from your reading assignments to develop your response.
