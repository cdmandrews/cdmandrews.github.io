[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

# Overview for Week 2

For this week, we're continuing our general introduction to TPW, especially focusing on [audience](https://writingcommons.org/section/information-literacy/information/consider-your-audience/), [exigence/purpose](https://writingcommons.org/section/rhetoric/rhetorical-situation/purpose/), and [genre](https://writingcommons.org/section/genre/). These concepts are important, and we'll come back to them again and again for the entire semester. We'll also spend time talking about correspondence genres, especially email and memos.

For this week you should read the following:
  - Review [OTC Chapter 1](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/0debb16b-f623-4033-a47b-973d65ab0961) (we read it last week)
  - [TWE Chapter 1: What is Technical Communication?](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/part/techcomm/)
  - [TWE Chapter 1.2: Conventions and Characteristics](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/conventions/)

## Audiences and TPW

"Know your audience" and "You are not your audience" are important points to wrap your brains around. Audience analysis is the process of figuring out who your audience is so you can write to their needs rather than your own. Getting out of your own head and into an audience's head is HARD, and is something we'll practice a. lot. this semester.

Two big audience-related points that TPW students nearly always trip over are dumb audiences and general audiences, and I want to talk about them in a little bit of detail here.

### Dumb Audiences, aka "Uncle Steve"

I have this imaginary (slightly based in reality) figure in my classrooms named "Uncle Steve." Every family has an Uncle Steve--that person that needs things explained to them five times and still doesn't quite understand (and maybe doesn't want to). The dude who always derails your Facebook or Instagram comments with some irrelevant stuff about "kids these days don't know how to whatever anymore..." Uncle Steve is nice enough, and you love him, but he's kind of a moron.

A lot of times in professional and technical writing you'll see guidance to "explain it to me like I'm six", which assumes that all technical writing is about making really complex things sensible to people with zero knowledge of the subject. That's a one-dimensional way of looking at professional and technical writing.

Doing audience analysis is not about assuming your audience is dumber than you. (Put yourself in the reverse position--do you want everyone assuming you're the dumb one? nope.) It's about considering what they know, what they need to know, and how they need to know it. If you write like a 6th-grader to a Ph.D. or a small-business owner, you're going to make someone mad. Figure out who the specific person is on the other end of your communication (in User Experience we use something called [personas](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html) to do that) and write to them. [The Plain Language Act site has a great resource on this concept](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/audience/).

### General audiences, aka "The public"

The lazy person’s answer to “who’s your audience?” on social media and lots of government or organizational communication is “the general public.” That is wrong.  Here's a solid essay on the topic if you want to read someone other than me say it: [There is No General Public: Starting with Audience for Stronger Science Communication Plans](https://medium.com/science-communication-media/there-is-no-general-public-starting-with-audience-for-stronger-science-communication-plans-6603a81da8d6)

One more time for the people in the back: "The general public" is not your audience.

Certainly, everybody is able to see and access your stuff. That’s among the default implications of rhetorical velocity and social media as a delivery system and public access to information in a transparent democratic republic. But really we should be talking about publics and groups: audiences rather than some generic “the public.” **Audiences are people who need or will work with your content, and are those folks whom your content is designed specifically for.** That [publically available government web page about victim impact statements](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ak/victim-impact-statements) uses "you" and "your" in its language, and that pronoun is directed to very specific people: victims of a crime. That's substantially different from "the general public." The CCISD Facebook page might be out there for anyone and their aunt to see, but their audience is specifically CCISD community of parents, administration and staff, and students.

Even though "the public" might have access to your document, that doesn't mean your document's audience is the public. The public is a **stakeholder**--that's why we have access, because it affects us and we should be able to see how our federal, state, and local governments function to a reasonable extent. But the audience--the people for whose use it is purposefully written--is different. In the case of a police report, for example, there are really three (mostly unfriendly) audiences who are going to use/read the document in different ways:
1. The supervisor, who is looking for incorrect grammar, missing details, incorrect facts/notations, and unclear narratives. Mostly wants to make sure the document is tight for CYA
2. The district attorney/prosecutor, who doesn't care about grammar or how well the officer presents himself or herself; the DA is looking to determine if the suspect should be charged and prosecuted and is thus looking for details that will correspond with legal statutes.
3. The defense attorney wants to derail the whole thing and looks for errors, missing information, contradictions, grammar errors that lead to confusion, and unethical/nonstandard police behaviors in the report.

She published this research in 2017 as [_Genres of Power_](https://www.amazon.com/Genre-Power-Writers-Readers-Rhetoric/dp/0814118429)</sub>

**Some examples of distinguishing between audiences:**
- Look at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Guide to Writing for Social Media, appendix A](https://www.cdc.gov/socialmedia/tools/guidelines/pdf/GuidetoWritingforSocialMedia.pdf). Look on page XX to read about how the CDC segments their audience and the roles they segment their audience into.
- Another breakdown of audiences is over at the World Health Organization (WHO). See [“Goal and key audiences”](https://www.who.int/about/communications/goal-and-key-audiences)
and how they segment their audience into some specific roles.


## For Tuesday
1. Locate three examples of what you consider technical and professional writing. These may include correspondence, journal articles, lab reports, manuals, web pages, advertisements, or something else.
2. In your group's "Intro to Tech Writing" forum, share your examples and discuss with your group members how your documents reflect specific conventions and characteristics of technical writing you read about in this week's readings. (Also worth considering: the difference between TPW and journalistic writing.) Quote relevant passages from our reading assignments in your post. Identify the specific audience(s) and purpose(s) for your examples.

## For Thursday

  - My **correspondence video discusses you attitude and other nonsense.**


1. Search the internet for at least three advice or how-to articles on workplace or professional email. (There are lots! Here's a starter for you, from the [Heroic Technical Writing blog](https://heroictechwriting.com/2011/12/20/using-the-tools-effectively)).
1. Write a post in your group's "Email for Dummies" forum in which you do the following:
  - List links and titles for your three articles, and write a 50-word summary for each one.
  - Discuss some of what you think are the most important **principles** for work email you read about in those three articles and your textbook chapters. These could be style tips as well as workplace culture tips like how frequently to check email or when to do email, or even reflections on gender, culture, and style.
  - Describe a recent example of an email you sent that either succeeds or fails by those principles. If it was great, explain specifically why it was; if it wasn't, explain how you might have done better in that situation.
  - Quote relevant passages from our reading assignments in your post and connect your examples and summaries to ideas about audience and purpose.

## Looking ahead

In [week 3](week-03-notes) we'll continue exploring audience and turn to focus specifically on social justice and ethics. Spoilers: [professional and technical writing should not be used to exploit, repress, or oppress human beings](https://attw.org/blog/the-just-use-of-imagination-a-call-to-action/).

The topic is charged, especially right now, and always runs the risk of getting a little prickly. Though we don't normally have real explosions or problems in the discussion forums in this class, I will take this moment to remind everyone about the syllabus' "Statement of Civility":

>Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi has a diverse student population that represents the population of the state. Our goal is to provide you with a high quality educational experience that is free from repression. You are responsible for following the rules of the University, city, state and federal government. We expect that you will behave in a manner that is dignified, respectful and courteous to all people, regardless of sex, ethnic/racial origin, religious background, sexual orientation or disability. Behaviors that infringe on the rights of another individual will not be tolerated.

This statement does not mean "don't disagree," but it does mean that we all expect our backgrounds, identities, and personhoods to be respected; name-calling, threats, and angry flaming are all unacceptable.
