## What do we do with computer/tech literacy in English studies?

A few notes from Selber, Stuart. (2004). _Multiliteracies for a Digital Age_. SIUP.

> “Teachers have not always seen the development and reconfiguration of literacy technologies as their job or as the instructional domain of students in writing and communication courses” (10).

Selbert’s project in <cite>Multilieracies</cite> is to call BS on this mentality carefully and at length, positing a more careful definition of technological literacies and a **postcritical** (ethical pragmatic) stance on computing and culture.

*   Obstacle to doing computer literacy/technology/digital literacy in English & writing courses 1: Prevailing myths about computers:
    *   Computer as solution to all problems;  The all-powerful computer
    *   The myth of equality through computers; levelling the educational playing field, but “equal access” =/= parity
    *   Computers automatically make people more productive; the cost-effectiveness argument, reducing instructional costs
*   Obstacle(s) to doing computer literacy/technology/digital literacy in English & writing courses 2: pedagogical and institutional impediments
    *   Invisibility of computer-related work in ENGL
    *   Writing teachers not consulted in design of computer-supported writing environments
    *   Teacher ed. courses that don’t deal adequately with problems for computing in ed.
*   We need an approach to computer literacy that is “useful and professionally responsible” (6) Do we teach students to #resist, or socialize students into the existing ideological order? Selber argues this is a poor binary to rely on.

   </td>
   <td>A rhetorically literate student understands that interface design problems are ill-defined problems whose solutions are representational arguments that have been arrived at through various deliberative activities.

## What to do for Week 03:

1. Create a github account (what is github? Why version control?) and set up the repository for your personal site. You are not *required* to use github, but it is an excellent option for the kinds of sites we'll be making. And is free.
  * Read the [Guide to creating and hosting a personal site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) When you get to “Using Jekyll with GitHub Pages” (the second half of the walkthrough), STOP.
  * Use the dummy text in the walkthrough and publish the simple HTML and CSS pages. When you're done, these will be available on the public web. Change all references to “Hank Quinlan” in your HTML file to your own name. Add other text if you want, but don’t stress about it at this point.
  * When your page is available on the public web, email me the URL.
  * **Recommended, not required:** Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and connect it with your account. This app will simplify uploading/downloading (i.e. commits, pushes, and pulls) files to your site.
2. Be working on copy for your profile site. What content do you want to have there, and what do you want it to say? Don’t worry about design yet--we’ll get to that. But first comes the content. You can write it up in markdown or your word processor. (Google Docs has a nifty Docs-to-Markdown add-on if you're working with content that already exists as a doc)
  * Think Eyman & Ball: **Use, usability, usefulness**. Who are your users? Why would users visit the site, what will they do there, and how? Why is the site necessary?
  * Also poke around the internet for examples of the genre--what are some  **conventions** around profile/portfolio sites? If we were going to define the genre, what would we include?
    - A genre is a recurring/shared form that has generic semantic content, syntactic or formal features, and (most importantly) pragmatic value as social action (Miller & Shepherd 2004)
3. Read Eyman 2, Stolley 4-5, 10-11, 16. We'll talk a bit of rhetoric and then mostly do some rhetoric, building HTML pages, learning about elements, tags, semantics, structure, metadata, etc.
