## Tactical Technical Communication

In ["The Golden Age of Technical Communication" (2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047281616641927) Miles Kimball (a tech comm professor at Rennsaeler Polytechnical) describes the general historical movement in the profession of technical communication from **strategic technical communication** to **tactical technical communication**. His concern in the article is getting a sense of the "vast, underrecognized landscape of technical communication as enacted by nearly everyone in the world who communicates about or through technology" (2017, p. 346). He's also interested in the implications of what he calls today's "Golden Age of Technical Communication" for academic programs and the discipline of technical communication--i.e. those people who have job titles like "technical writer" or "technical communicator." What does a "broader view" of technical communication mean for working technical communicators?

A radical simplification of his historical overview is that tech comm has developed slowly over time into a distinct profession growing out of engineering, defense technology, and computer industries. In that traditional sense, technical communicators are people who are paid by companies to do their technical communicating. They create *strategic technical communication* for those companies and institutions. But now that much of the world's population has networked computers with which they can create their own documentation, they are creating technical communication every day, just because they want to, and without getting paid for it. That is the domain of *tactical technical communication*. Today, "many people have grown so adept at using technologies that they do not use or need corporate-designed technical documentation; instead, they make technical documentation themselves to share with other users" (p. 340). We have started look beyond corporations for help, instead turning to other people, just like us, who use and modify and tinker with technology.

**Strategic technical communication** is institutionally-motivated technical communication, and has the following qualities:
- occurs inside formal organizations and traditional institutional contexts
- **professional**: created by specialist producers from knowledge derived from education and subject matter experts (someone's getting paid)
- **invisible**: or "typically visible only in the context of failure" (p. 343) (i.e. you don't read the manual until the thing isn't working; i.e. you don't realize how much technical communication is all around you everyday.)
- **user-centered**: focused on needs of the user, but ultimately in order to "sell products, to avoid liability, and to foster customer loyalty" (p. 344). User-centeredness is a means to an end.
- **anonymous**: most commonly, the corporation is the author in that they put their name on and are responsible for the discourse, and the name of the individuals that created it likely do not appear on the document
- **controlled**: highly controlled by the institution and corporation, typified by high-quality output but may lack authenticity
- *Examples*: The product manual that comes with your TV remote. An annual report for a company or organization. Pamphlets on breastfeeding from La Leche League international. A printout of a treatment plan from your doctor. Reports, proposals, and correspondence you write as part of your job. A company or institution's website and social media presence. Washer/dryer maintenance videos on YouTube from PartSelect.com. Official marketing for a popular video game or movie.

**Tactical technical communication** is user-motivated or community-motivated technical communication, and has the following qualities:
- occurs outside formal organizations and traditional institutional contexts
- **amateur**, created by user-producers from knowledge derived from their experience (ain't nobody getting paid)
- **visible**, "a voluntary contribution to public discourse. It typically puts itself out there and hopes to be heard--perhaps to to entertain, as well as instruct" (p. 343)
- **user-created**: created by users for users based in their own experience, not by companies for users in a vaguely paternalistic or marketing sense
- **personal** and authored with pride in the sense of the individual author getting credit/reputation/kudos for their contributions; may be anonymous depending on the goals of the communication/author
- **authentic**: not controlled by corporations and institutions, makes up for potential low quality with authenticity
- *Examples*: Unofficial discussion forums for a product. Reddit explanations. Online breastfeeding forums (or cat leukemia forums, or psychiatry forums, or diabetes forums). Hacktivist guides. DIY hormone replacement therapy manuals. Washer/dryer maintenance videos by some random dude on YouTube. Fan-created marketing for a popular video game or movie.

Tactical technical communication occurs between and outside of institutions and corporations. Occasionally, corporations will in fact attempt to leverage or co-opt the expertise of user communities by creating sponsored online forums or inviting user-generated content. But often tactical tech comm happens outside instiutions--even despite them and against them in many cases, especially in the case of online health communities, where users feel overlooked, forgotten, or ignored by medical experts and turn to communal expertise for help in navigating the complexities of their conditions.

The table below compares examples of strategic and tactical technical communication, showing basically the same forms and genres of TC in strategic contexts versus tactical contexts:
