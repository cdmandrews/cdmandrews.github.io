## Looking ahead

You did it! Thanks for an excellent semester, especially for showing a great deal of resilience and a ton of grace under pressure. This class is normally online, but I know there's been absolutely nothing normal about this semester. Heck, I've had to get up twice while writing this short paragraph to make sure my 7th grader is on task in her Zoom class. Some of us have done just fine, and others have juuuust scraped through by the skin of our knuckles, and we probably all are feeling pretty rattled at this moment. But know this: if you're reading this, **you've made it!** Take a breath, take a nap, and eat some leftover pie or stuffing or whatever. Next week? No classes, baby.
