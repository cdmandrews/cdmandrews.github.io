# Overview for Week 16

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

## Big picture (Draft draft)

This is the finish! Your final project is due and you may turn it in any time between Tuesday December 1 and Saturday December 5. Don't forget to include your reflection memo.

## Looking ahead

You did it! Thanks for an excellent semester, especially for showing a great deal of resilience and a ton of grace under pressure. This class is normally online, but I know there's been absolutely nothing normal about this semester. Heck, I've had to get up twice while writing this short paragraph to make sure my 7th grader is on task in her Zoom class. Some of us have done just fine, and others have juuuust scraped through by the skin of our knuckles, and we probably all are feeling pretty rattled at this moment. But know this: if you're reading this, **you've made it!** Take a breath, take a nap, and eat some leftover pie or stuffing or whatever. Next week? No classes, baby.
