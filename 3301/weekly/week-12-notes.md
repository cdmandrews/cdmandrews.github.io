# Overview for Week 12

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

## Big picture

## Tuesday

Participate in the &quot;Project 2 Q&amp;A&quot; forum thread in your group:

  1. The second project asks you to select a professional communication topic, problem, or genre that youâ€™d like to expand on from Project 1 and create a technical or professional document that will will help a specific audience learn, do, or make a decision about something. For today&#39;s post, you will locate relevant information about this project, assess the task, and ask questions about it.
  2. Before you write your response to this post, you should review the [project description for Project 1](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-2).
  3. Post a reply to the &quot;Project 2 Q&amp;A&quot; discussion thread about your understanding of the first major project. Write about your understanding of the assignment, and any questions you have about it.
  4. Return to this thread later in the week. Review your group members&#39; responses and see if what others have written helps you answer your question. Try to answer questions posted by your fellow students!
  5. **You must discuss and respond to each others' questions and threads to get full credit on this one. I will, too. Interactivity is the whole point.**

## Thursday (draft draft)

A proposal is usually an offer or bid to do something for someone. Proposals might be requested/invited, or they might be unsolicited. Whichever the case, and whatever its specific details, a proposal is a **persuasive** document that asks someone to approve the project (or fund it, or give permission to do it, etc).

A proposal makes two arguments: 1) this thing I want to do is worth doing, and 2) I am the person to do it.  (It's different from a feasability report, which argues whether something is possible, or a recommendation report, which argues about which way we should do something out of a number of options.)

Submit a proposal for your second project. We'll use a template as we did for the first major project, but to simplify things a bit I will share files with you to fill in. Check your email for an invitation to share from me.

  Write a proposal that describes the project you're thinking of doing. Write to me as if I'm your manager or funder, not just your instructor. Remember to provide specific details rather than vague generalizations. If you are collaborating with other students, include all of your names in the "from" line; you are only required to submit one proposal for the group.
  Your proposal should do the following:
  - describe the problem or issue you want to work on: what's the subject, and what do you want to create?
  - explain why it's beneficial or needed--what will the communication you want to create DO for its audience? why should I be interested in this project?
  - explain project milestones
  - explain resources you'll need to make use of (equipment and supplies, assistance from others, etc)
  - explain your qualifications: summarize why you're qualified to do this project
  - conclude with one last pitch and an offer to reach out for more details or discussion, or urge me to contact you with my approval.

## Looking ahead

[Next week](week-13-notes) will be heavy lifting on your projects. Get. Things. Done.
