# Overview for Week 12

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

## Big picture

This week, you're working on wrapping your heads around the second project. To help you do that, we'll write a common genre: **the proposal**.

A proposal (in some fields it might be called a *pitch*) is usually an offer or bid to do something for someone. Proposals might be invited, or they might be unsolicited. Often, proposals are written in response to a "Request for Proposals" or RFP. Whichever the case, and whatever its specific details, **a proposal is a persuasive document that describes the goals and methods of a project clearly as part of making a case for the reader to approve the project**.

A proposal makes two arguments:
1. this thing I want to do is worth doing, and
2. I am the person to do it.  

Proposals are different from a *feasability report*, which argues whether something is possible, or a *recommendation report*, which argues about which way we should do something out of a number of options.

Review the [ETC chapter on Proposals](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/proposals/) or the [OTC chapter on Proposals](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/a2dba47a-9aa3-425b-9c59-8901176383d7)


A few proposals in the wild:
- [Texas Parks and Wildilfe Department research proposal: Assessing UAV-FLIR Technology to Survey Wild Turkeys](https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/research/docs/2-Wild-Turkey-RFP.pdf)
- [Lamar State College proposal to establish a new nursing program](https://www.bon.texas.gov/pdfs/board_meetings_pdfs/2015/October/3-2-8-a-PUBLIC.pdf)
- [Research proposal: proposal to study experiences of disabled faculty in higher ed](https://prod-ncte-cdn.azureedge.net/nctefiles/groups/cccc/research-initiative/sampleproposal.pdf)

If you're interested, check out some of these Requests for Proposals (RFPs), which will give you an idea of what proposal-readers are looking for. RFPs are frequently in the style of contracts, though the proposals people write in response will look very different.. As with many situations, the first step to a succesful proposal understanding your audience, their needs and values, and their requirements or conventions.

## Tuesday

Participate in the &quot;Project 2 Q&amp;A&quot; forum thread in your group:

  1. The second project asks you to select a professional communication topic, problem, or genre that youâ€™d like to expand on from Project 1 and create a technical or professional document that will will help a specific audience learn, do, or make a decision about something. For today&#39;s post, you will locate relevant information about this project, assess the task, and ask questions about it.
  2. Before you write your response to this post, you should review the [project description for Project 2](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-2).
  3. Post a reply to the &quot;Project 2 Q&amp;A&quot; discussion thread about your understanding of the first major project. Write about your understanding of the assignment, and any questions you have about it.
  4. Return to this thread later in the week. Review your group members&#39; responses and see if what others have written helps you answer your question. Try to answer questions posted by your fellow students!
  5. **You must discuss and respond to each others' questions and threads to get full credit on this one. I will, too. Interactivity is the whole point.**

## Thursday (draft draft)

Submit a proposal for your second project. We'll use a template as we did for the first major project, but to simplify things a bit I will share files with you to fill in. **Check your email for an invitation to share from me and have your proposal filled out by Thursday evening**.

Write a proposal that describes what you're thinking of doing for Project 2. Write to me as if I'm your manager or funder, not just your instructor. Remember to provide specific details rather than vague generalizations. If you are collaborating with other students, include all of your names in the "from" line; you are only required to submit one proposal for the group.

Your proposal should do the following:
  1. Describe the problem, issue, or topic you want to work on: what's the subject and what do you want to create?
  2. Explain why your project is beneficial or needed: what will the communication you want to create DO for its audience? Why should I be interested in or approve this project?
  3. Explain project plan and milestones: a list of major and minor steps for getting it done
  4. Explain your qualifications: summarize why you're qualified to do this project
  5. Conclude with a final summary of the project and its worth, and close with either an offer to reach out for more details or discussion, or urge me to contact you with my approval.

## Looking ahead

[Next week](week-13-notes) will be heavy lifting on your projects. There are no weekly assignments or readings--it's just **time to &#x1F44F;	Get. &#x1F44F;	Things. &#x1F44F;	 Done.**
