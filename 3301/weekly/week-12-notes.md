# Notes and Overview for Week 12
[ENGL 3301, Fall 2021](../calendar.html)

## Communicating profesh

We've been talking about technical and **professional** writing all semester, but this week, I'd like us to step back and take a long, hard, critical look at how American workplace cultures make sense of that slippery concept called "professionalism."

Standards of professionalism (such as appearance standards and language standards) are culturally determined--they are legislated in organizations and embodied on, well, our bodies. My body. Your bodies. Unfortunately for many folx, standards of professionalism (i.e. what it means to act like, look like, sound like, and write like a professional) are [manifestations of systemic bias in organizations (Okun & Jones)](https://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/White_Supremacy_Culture_Okun.pdf). That accusation of systemic bias doesn't mean we burn it all down, but it does mean we should take a long, hard, critical look at what we're doing, why we're doing it, and who it affects, and then we need to do the work to make changes and advocate for better futures.

Think about the word **professionalism**. What does that mean? What images does your mind's eye conjure up? What does it mean to "look professional" and "sound professional" and "act professionally"? If you [do a Google image search of "professional" whose picture are you most likely to see](https://theconversation.com/googles-algorithms-discriminate-against-women-and-people-of-colour-112516)?

Read and reflect on any four of these articles about race, culture, authenticity, and how we perform professionalism:
  - [Authenticity in the workplace as a Latinx professional](https://www.alley.com/post/authenticity-in-the-workplace-as-a-latinx-professional) (video)
  - [Why professional dress? Dress Profesh](https://dressprofesh.com/whydress) (video)
  - [Minorities who 'whiten' job resumes get more interviews](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews)
  - [The bias of professionalism standards](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_bias_of_professionalism_standards)
  - [Racism runs deep in professionalism culture](https://tulanehullabaloo.com/51652/intersections/business-professionalism-is-racist/)
  - [U.S. Latinos feel they can't be themselves at work](https://hbr.org/2016/10/u-s-latinos-feel-they-cant-be-themselves-at-work)
  - [Is it unprofessional for doctors to have tattoos or facial piercings?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6110655/)

A few years ago in one of my tech writing classes, we were talking about email when a student (who was already working as a paralegal for a law firm in town) told a story about when she was told not to use pink fonts in her work emails because "it wasn't professional." She commented" "I think I should be able to use a pink font in my emails if I want to." "Damn right," I replied. Why, exactly, isn't pink professional? Look, there are legitimate concerns about accessibility and color contrast. Using pink on white is physiologically difficult to read because the contrast ratio is so low, and that's a legitimate reason to not use pink fonts in your email. But the larger cultural issue this points to is real--how much latitude can and should we have to massage genre conventions, especially because many of our ideas about *appropriate* style and professionalism are deeply [gendered](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/11/4/1012/4617714) and [racial](https://www.academia.edu/download/35205268/Medina_Tweeting_Identity_CRE.pdf)? Should we--and how can we--convey something about ourselves in genres like resumes, emails, and cover letters? How much of ourselves do we put on our LinkedIn profile? What are the distinctions between our personal and professional identities? [Which people in the same working environment have to dress up, how far, and why? Which races and genders get to be outspoken, and what happens when someone from a group speaks up?](https://money.cnn.com/2015/11/25/news/economy/racial-discrimination-work/index.html) And why is it okay for all the old white dudes on the faculty to wear Hawaiian shirts?

How does all that translate over to professional writing? How do you want people to see you? What do you want them to know about you? How might you represent that in your writing and document design?

## For Tuesday

**After reading and reflecting on these articles, write a post in your "Communicating Profesh" group forum responding to the following questions:**
  - What institutions and/or structures shape how you understand “professional behavior”? What’s considered “normal” professional behavior? What are the consequences of participating in structures that reinforce normative notions of professionalism? What might it look like to resist such structures?
  - When working within the standard written genre conventions and document designs of resumes, formal letters, emails, and text messages, what could you do to convey a sense of who you are and what you value? What are the risks--and rewards--of doing so?
  - Yes, refer back to your readings as you develop your response.
  - Yes, discuss and converse with at least 3 other folks in your group.
  - Yes, write no fewer than 250 words. Probably more for this one.

## For Thursday

You've got no assignment due this Thursday. Use this time to work on your report. Do research. Write things. Schedule an appointment with your professor to talk about your progress or get some help with your research.

Keep in mind the core questions you're trying to answer with your research and examples:

- Option 1 asks: What constitutes “good” technical writing in your field? What interesting or important features typify it? How do writers produce it?

- Option 2 asks: What makes these user-created examples technical communication? What interesting features typify it? What possibilities does present for technical communicators inside and outside the workplace?
