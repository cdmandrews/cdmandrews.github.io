# Overview for Week 4

## Document design and "looking professional"

What does how a document looks and how a document works have to do with what a document does? **finish writing this article**

**To read this week:**
- [Subheadings: Perhaps the Most Useful Technique in Technical Writing](https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/08/23/subheadings-perhaps-the-most-useful-technique-in-technical-writing/) is an excellent article about subheadings that also actually practices what it preaches.

An effective document design helps your intended audience locate and understand the information they need when they need it. As you may realize from reading the assigned texts, designing uncluttered pages that are easy to read, meet and audience's genre expectations, and satisfiy our own purposes is not as simple as it might sound. Because of all of the bells and whistles in our word processors, it's very easy to create ineffective documents.

[This Google Drive folder contains two Environmental Impact Statements (including all attachments) and a small selection of NTSB Accident reports.](http) They are just a resource so you can see examples of different styles of headings in reports. As you review them, think about how headings help readers with different agendas or purposes navigate documents? What can you tell about the intended audiences of the document by looking at the headings and how they present and guide readers through content? How would executive readers use the document differently than technical readers? How does the report support those (and other kinds) of reading?

## For Tuesday

For this post, review the [City of Corpus Christi 2020 Hurricane Preparedness handout](https://www-cdn.cctexas.com/sites/default/files/FIRDEP-eoc-hurricane-prepardness-information.pdf)

Evaluate the document's design: what works, what doesn't, and why? Suggest specific revisions for improving any problem areas you discover in the handout. Use at least 5 of the following points in your discussion:
- How effectively has the designer used blank space to frame/group information?
- Are there too many lists? Not enough lists? The right type of lists?
- Is type of a legible size, color, and design?
- Is text spaced adequately for reading and skimming?
- Are line length and margin style effective?
- Are words and illustrations complementary?
- Does the designer use frequent, descriptive, and distinctive headings?

In your own post, help readers scan and locate information by using descriptive, distinctive headings and other document design elements.

Later this week, respond to at least three other people in your group.

As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document!

## For Thursday

Think about the word **professionalism**. What does that mean? What images does your mind's eye conjure up? If you [do a Google image search of "professional" whose picture are you most likely to see](https://theconversation.com/googles-algorithms-discriminate-against-women-and-people-of-colour-112516)?

Read three or four of these articles about race, culture, authenticity, and how we perform professionalism:
  - [Authenticity in the workplace as a Latinx professional](https://www.alley.com/post/authenticity-in-the-workplace-as-a-latinx-professional) (video)
  - [Why professional dress? Dress Profesh](https://dressprofesh.com/whydress) (video)
  - [The bias of professionalism standards](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_bias_of_professionalism_standards)
  - [Racism runs deep in professionalism culture](https://tulanehullabaloo.com/51652/intersections/business-professionalism-is-racist/)
  - [U.S. Latinos feel they can't be themselves at work](https://hbr.org/2016/10/u-s-latinos-feel-they-cant-be-themselves-at-work)
  - [Minorities who 'whiten' job resumes get more interviews](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews)

A few years ago in one of my tech. writing classes, we were talking about email when a student (who was already working for a law firm in town) commented "I think I should be able to use a pink font in my emails if I want to." Damn right, I replied. Look, there are legitimate concerns about accessibility and color contrast. Using pink on white is physiologically difficult to read because the contrast ratio is so low. But the issue here is real--how much latitude can and should we have to massage genre conventions, especially because many of our ideas about *appropriate* style and professionalism are deeply [gendered](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/11/4/1012/4617714) and [racial](https://www.academia.edu/download/35205268/Medina_Tweeting_Identity_CRE.pdf)? How can we convey something about ourselves in genres like resumes, emails, and cover letters? How much of ourselves do we put on our LinkedIn profile? What are the distinctions between our personal and  professional identities? [Which people in the same working environment have to dress up, how far, and why? Which races and genders get to be outspoken, and what happens when someone from a group speaks up?](https://money.cnn.com/2015/11/25/news/economy/racial-discrimination-work/index.html) And why is it okay for all the old white dudes on the faculty to wear Hawaiian shirts?

How does all that translate over to professional writing? How do you want people to see you? What do you want them to know about you? How might you represent that in your writing and document design?

**After reading and reflecting on these articles, write a post in your group forum responding to the following questions:**
  - When working within the standard written genre conventions and document designs of resumes, formal letters, emails, and text messages, how can you maintain (or convey a sense of) who you are and what you value?
  - What institutions and/or structures shape how you understand “professional behavior”? What’s considered “normal” professional behavior? What are the consequences of participating in structures that reinforce normative notions of professionalism? What might it look like to resist such structures?
  - Yes, refer back to your readings as you develop your response.
  - Yes, discuss and converse with your group people.

## Looking ahead

In [week 5](week-05-notes) we're getting into style: words, sentences, and all that good stuff. Buckle up!

We'll also take a look at social media and technical/professional communication. Not "don't post drunk pix on insta", but instead, why and how do organizations and institutions use social media to meet their missions and connect with their audiences?
