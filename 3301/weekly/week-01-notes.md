# Overview for Week 1

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

## Big picture

<span style="color:red;">*No assignments or course documents, including the syllabus, should be considered to be in their final form until the first week of class begins.*</span>

Each week, I'll provide you an overview (just like this document). The information here will detail specific readings, exercises, and due dates for each week. In general, when people email me about being confused about what to do that week, I will ask them "Did you check the overview?" Always check these weekly documents first! I will structure coursework around a Tuesday/Thursday schedule, so you will see assignments and readings broken up into two days each week. To read more about how and why the course is scheduled the way it is, please review the "Course Conduct" section of our syllabus.

If you find something in error, or are confused about any part of the instructions, please email me at [christopher.andrews@tamucc.edu](mailto:christopher.andrews@tamucc.edu). If your question is one that the entire class will benefit from hearing, I will likely repost it in course announcements or the Troubleshooting forum!

We have a lot to do for this first week:

- Clarify the nature of and goals for the course
- Get situated for online learning
- Get to know each other a bit
- Get started thinking about the distinctions between writing for work and writing for school.

## Okay, let's start with "Technical Writing" (Whatever that is)
<sub>(Adapted from https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/intro.htm)</sub>

Technical and professional writing (TPW) courses introduce you to some of the most important aspects of writing in the worlds of science, technology, and business—in other words, _the kind of writing that scientists, nurses, doctors, computer specialists, government officials, engineers, and other such people do as a part of their regular work_.

One thing you'll hear me say a lot is that TPW is all about **using writing to do something**. It's not there for the sake of itself or for entertainment--TPW has a purpose and and audience and they **need** your writing to get their work done. (Though they may not know it.)

To learn how to write effectively for the world of work, you'll study common situations for and and genres of writing in your future career. You'll practice special format items such as lists and headings, techniques for putting graphics into your work, and some techniques for producing professional-looking documents.

TPW courses build on what you've learned in other writing courses, adding deeper consideration of audience and situation and special writing and design strategies to your communication toolbox. If you currently have a job or internship in which you do some writing, you'll discover that you can put what you learn in your TPW course to immediate use.

### About Technical Communication
The field of technical communication is essential in a wide range of fields and occupations. It is a fully professional field with degree programs, certifications, research, and theory. [It's a good field with a lot of growth and income potential](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/technical-writers.htm); and this introductory TPW course is a good way to start if you are interested in a career in this field.

**Workplace writing.** The focus for this particular TPW course is not necessarily a career as a technical writer but an introduction to the kinds of writing skills you need in [practically any professional job](https://medium.com/@kesiparker/business-writing-vs-technical-writing-3389b5648c50). No matter what sort of professional work you do, you're likely to do lots of writing—and much of it technical in nature. The more you know about some basic tech. writing skills, the better job of writing you're likely to do. [And that will be good for the projects you work on, for the organizations you work in, and—most of all—good for you and your career](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gretasolomon/2018/08/09/why-mastering-writing-skills-can-help-future-proof-your-career).

**The meaning of "technical."** Technical communication—or technical writing, as the course is often called—is not writing about a specific technical topic such as computers, but about any technical topic. The term "technical" refers to knowledge that is not widespread, that is the territory of experts and specialists. Whatever your major is, you are developing an expertise in concepts and processes and content knowledge: you are becoming a specialist in a particular technical area. And whenever you try to write or say anything about your field, you are engaged in technical communication.

**Importance of audience.** Another key part of the definition of technical communication is the audience. Technical communication is *transactional*: it is a "purposeful transaction between sender and receiver that provides specific information for practical and specific purposes and is usually geared towards the needs of a specific audience" ([TWE Ch 1](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/part/techcomm/)). Because of this transactional nature, professional and technical writers must adapt information to their audiences' needs, level of understanding, and background. Professional and technical writing helps readers **do things**: understand a new process, learn a new technique, make a complex decision, understand what happened, and so forth. In the context of workplace and technical communication, if your reader can't understand the writing there's a BIG problem. (And it ain't usually the reader's fault.)



Note: As well as this introductory course, TAMU-CC also has a [TPW minor](https://catalog.tamucc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=13&poid=1186), a Writing for NonProfits certificate, and a Technical Communication BAS Track. With practice in a variety of genres, modes, techniques, and tons of writing skills, the TPW Minor is an excellent accompaniment to any course of study.
