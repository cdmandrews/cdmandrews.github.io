# Overview for Week 1

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

## Big picture

<span style="color:red;">*No assignments or course documents, including the syllabus, should be considered to be in their final form until the first week of class begins.*</span>

Each week, I'll provide you an overview (just like this document). The information here will detail specific readings, exercises, and due dates for each week. In general, when people email me about being confused about what to do that week, I will ask them "Did you check the overview?" Always check these weekly documents first! I will structure coursework around a Tuesday/Thursday schedule, so you will see assignments and readings broken up into two days each week. To read more about how and why the course is scheduled the way it is, please review the "Course Conduct" section of our syllabus.

If you find something in error, or are confused about any part of the instructions, please email me at [christopher.andrews@tamucc.edu](mailto:christopher.andrews@tamucc.edu). If your question is one that the entire class will benefit from hearing, I will likely repost it in course announcements or the Troubleshooting forum!

We have a lot to do for this first week:

- Clarify the nature of and goals for the course

  - Introduce yourself, your background, and your #goals. What should we know about you and your identity?
  - Describe professional or job-related writing experience you have. Did you have to use a company email account for that internship? Did you write reports for twenty years before coming back to college? Did you ever take meeting minutes for a club you're in? Did you help manage an Instagram account for a nonprofit? Do you have a work email account? Have you ever had to write a personal statement to get a promotion?
