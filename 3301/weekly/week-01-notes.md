# Overview for Week 01

<img src="media/tech-comm-tarly.jpg" title="Always read the instructions" alt="Always read the instructions" style="float:right; width:50%;">

Each week, I'll provide you an overview (just like this document). These docs will detail specific readings, exercises, and due dates for each week. In general, when people email me about being confused about what to do that week, I will ask them "Did you check the overview?" Always check these weekly documents first! I will structure coursework around a Tuesday/Thursday schedule, so you will see assignments and readings broken up into two days each week. To read more about how and why the course is scheduled the way it is, please review the "Course Conduct" section of our syllabus.

If you find something in error, or are confused about any part of the instructions, please email me at [christopher.andrews@tamucc.edu](mailto:christopher.andrews@tamucc.edu). If your question is one that the entire class will benefit from hearing, I will likely repost it in course announcements or the Troubleshooting forum!

## Okay, let's start with "Technical Writing" (Whatever that is)
<sub>(Adapted from https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/intro.htm)</sub>

Technical and professional writing (TPW) courses introduce you to some of the most important aspects of writing in the worlds of science, technology, and business—in other words, _the kind of writing that scientists, nurses, doctors, computer specialists, government officials, engineers, and other such people do as a part of their regular work_.

>Quick sales pitch: As well as this introductory course, TAMU-CC also has a [TPW minor](https://catalog.tamucc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=13&poid=1186), a Writing for NonProfits certificate, and a Technical Communication BAS Track. With practice in a variety of genres, modes, techniques, and emphasis on tons of communication skills, the TPW Minor is an excellent accompaniment to any course of study.

One thing you'll hear me say a lot is that TPW is all about **using writing to do something**. It's not there for the sake of itself or for entertainment--TPW has a purpose and an audience and those people **need** your writing to get their work done.

To learn how to write effectively for the world of work, in this class you'll study common situations for and and genres of writing in your future career. You'll practice special format items such as lists and headings, techniques for putting graphics into your work, and some techniques for producing professional-looking documents. And you'll research writing in your field by talking to experts and looking at real, working documents.

This TPW course will build on what you've learned in other writing courses, adding deeper consideration of audience and situation and special writing and design strategies to your communication toolbox. If you currently have a job or internship in which you do some writing, you'll discover that you can put what you learn in your TPW course to immediate use.

### About Technical Communication
The field of technical communication is essential in a wide range of fields and occupations. It is a fully professional field with degree programs, certifications, research, and theory. [It's a good field with a lot of growth and income potential](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/technical-writers.htm); and this introductory TPW course is a good way to start if you are interested in a career in this field.

**Workplace writing.** The focus for this particular TPW course is not necessarily a career as a technical writer but [an introduction to the kinds of writing skills you need in practically any professional job](https://medium.com/@kesiparker/business-writing-vs-technical-writing-3389b5648c50). No matter what sort of professional work you do, you're likely to do lots of writing, and much of it will be technical in nature. The more you know about some basic tech. writing skills, the better job of writing you're likely to do. [And that will be good for the projects you work on, for the organizations you work in, the society you live in, and most definitely good for you and your career](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gretasolomon/2018/08/09/why-mastering-writing-skills-can-help-future-proof-your-career).

**The meaning of "technical."** Technical communication—or technical writing, as the course is often called—is not writing about a specific technical topic such as computers, but about any technical topic. The term "technical" refers to knowledge that is not widespread, that is the territory of experts and specialists. Whatever your major is, you are developing an expertise in concepts and processes and content knowledge: you are becoming a specialist in a particular technical area. And whenever you try to write or say anything about your field, you are engaged in technical communication.

**Importance of audience.** Another key part of the definition of technical communication is the audience. For the first few weeks of the course, we're going to talk about a lot of concepts, but the thing that we'll really circle back to every time is _audience_. Technical communication is **transactional**: it is a "purposeful transaction between sender and receiver that provides specific information for practical and specific purposes and is usually geared towards the needs of a specific audience" ([TWE Ch 1](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/part/techcomm/)). Because of this transactional nature, professional and technical writers must adapt information to their audiences' needs, level of understanding, and background.

Professional and technical writing helps readers **do things**: understand a new process, learn a new technique, make a complex decision, understand what happened, and so forth. In the context of workplace and technical communication, if your reader can't understand the writing there's a BIG problem. (And it ain't usually the reader's fault.) So spending time considering your audience's needs, values, and perspectives is critical to creating effective, successful TPW. If you know who you're writing to and why, you can make all kinds of [rhetorical](https://writingcommons.org/section/rhetoric/) choices. As a professional who's going to have to use writing to help other people do stuff, [rhetorical awareness (the ability to think about goals and situations for writing)](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/effective_workplace_writing/index.html) is going to be a significant skill.

## Due Thursday, August 20 before midnight

1. Read [Chapter 1: Introduction to Technical Writing](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/0debb16b-f623-4033-a47b-973d65ab0961) from Open Technical Communication.

2. If you skipped my "Okay, let's start with technical writing (whatever that is)" notes above, back up and read them as well.

3. Post to your group's "Welcome" forum  **before midnight on Thursday**. Write a post in which you cover each of the following topics:
  - Introduce yourself, your background, and your #goals. What should we know about you and your identity? Also, have you taken online classes before, or is this your first? What strategies would you offer to your classmates for succeeding in an online class?
  - Choose a fictional character that represents who you are. At the end of your introduction, [post a gif of the character ](https://youtu.be/jp9HA6en5BA)and explain why you chose this character.
  - Describe professional or job-related writing experience you have and how the writing you did reflect the **six characteristics of technical writing** from the Open TC chapter you read. Did you have to use a company email account for that internship? Did you write reports for twenty years before coming back to college? Did you ever take meeting minutes for a club you're in? Did you help manage an Instagram account for a nonprofit? Do you have a work email account? Have you ever had to write a personal statement to get a promotion?
  - **Respond** to your group members' introductory statements. Say hello. Get to know each other. These are your fellow learners for the next 15 weeks.

## Looking ahead

In [week 2](week-02-notes) we're going to keep digging in on _audience_, talk about something called a _rhetorical situation_, and talk about the exciting world of _email_.

&#x1F525;&#x1F525;&#x1F4E7;&#x1F525;&#x1F525;

Remember that you can read/work ahead, but you are still responsible for engaging in actual discussion with your group members. They need to hear from you, and you need to hear from them. That's part of how you'll learn. Which is why you're here.
