# Notes and Overview for Week 10
[ENGL 3301, Fall 2021](../calendar.html)

## Moving towards the finish line: Major Project 2
Before you do anything else, go read [the description for the second major course project](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-2). You have two big options for this project, and should be able to pick something that's interesting, relevant, and engaging for you to work on for the rest of the term.
- Option 1 has you picking up where you left off with the fact sheet and doing a deeper dive on three particularly important kinds of TPW in your field.
- Option 2 asks you to explore technical communication outside the workplace, decide what makes it tech comm, and explore its implications.

Both of these options are described in detail on the [Project 2 page](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-2). This project is **due on November 30, the last regular week of classes**. The table below is a rundown of project-related due dates from the course schedule. This week, you will spend time locating relevant information about this project, discussing the task with me and with the other folks in your group, and working on your plan to complete it.

| Steps we'll take together: | Date     |
|---|---|
| Participate in Q&A discussion forum | October 28  |
| Share a progress report (I'll provide a template)  | November 11  |
| Share a (very) rough draft for peer review  | November 18 |
| Share a (less rough) draft for peer review  | November 23 |
| Submit your final draft  | November 30    |
| Submit final reflection and course debrief | December 9   |

We'll also complete the usual kinds of weekly activities during these weeks and explore a range of issues related to ethics and justice in technical and professional writing. (See "Looking ahead," at the bottom of this page.) These activities are designed help you develop additional content for your final report.

I got your back.

## For Tuesday

Review my [notes on tactical and strategic technical communication](tactical-tech-comm) and wrap your brain around major distinctions between the two kinds. Then think about what you'd like to focus your second main project on.

## For Thursday
<mark>Participate in your group's "Project 2 Q&amp;A" discussion thread before 5:00 pm on Thursday:</mark>

Before you write your response to this post, make sure you have read the [project description for Project 2](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-2) carefully and completely.

Post a reply to the Q&amp;A" thread about your understanding of the second major project. Write about:
1. your understanding of what we're doing with this project,
2. what documents you are thinking of exploring and why, and
3. at least two questions you have about this project that aren't answered here or on the description page.

Return to this thread on Thursday evening and Friday. Review your group members' responses, see if what others have written helps you answer your questions, and try to answer questions posted by your fellow students!

## Looking ahead
![Traffic warning sign reading 'Looking Ahead'](https://i1.wp.com/www.hudsonvalleysportsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Looking-Ahead.jpg?w=400&ssl=1)

Get started on that project. Find resources, and contact me if you're not sure how to begin.

During [Week 11](week-11-notes) we will begin the final "unit" in the course and explore a range of issues related to ethics and justice in technical and professional writing. Alongside working on your project we will do introductory dives into the following:
  - copyright and intellectual property
  - the problematic nature of professionalism standards
  - inclusion and language justice
  - balancing the 7Cs
  - accessibility and disability and workplace communication

And probably some other good stuff, too. Buckle up!
