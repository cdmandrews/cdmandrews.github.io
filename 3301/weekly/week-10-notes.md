# Notes and Overview for Week 10
[ENGL 3301, Fall 2021](../calendar.html)

Before you do anything else, go read the description for the second major course project at https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-2.

For this project, you have two options. You should be able to pick something that's interesting, relevant, and engaging for you to work on for the rest of the term.
- Option 1 has you picking up where you left off with the fact sheet and doing a deeper dive on three particularly important kinds of TPW in your field.
- Option 2 asks you to explore technical communication outside the workplace, decide what makes it tech comm, and explore its implications.

Both of these options are described in detail on the [Project 2 page](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-2).

This week, you will spend time locating relevant information about this project, discussing the task with me and with the other folks in your group, and working on your plan to complete it.

Importantly, if you are not sure at all about getting started looking for scholarship in academic and professional sources about technical and professional communication (whether in or out of the workplace), email me or set up an appointment ASAP.

I got your back.

## For Tuesday

Nothing is due for Tuesday. Take time to look ahead and plan your approach for this project:
- read through the instructions
- think about options for your project
- look at timelines and due dates for the rest of the semester
- start locating research sources


## For Thursday
Participate in your group's "Project 2 Q&amp;A" discussion thread before 5:00 pm on Thursday:

Before you write your response to this post, make sure you have read the [project description for Project 2](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-2) carefully and completely.

Post a reply to the Q&amp;A" thread about your understanding of the second major project. Write about:
1.  your understanding of what we're doing with this project,
2. what documents you are thinking of exploring and why, and
3. at least two questions you have about this project that aren't answered on the description page.

Return to this thread on Thursday evening and Friday. Review your group members' responses, see if what others have written helps you answer your question, and try to answer questions posted by your fellow students!

## Looking ahead
![Traffic warning sign reading 'Looking Ahead'](https://i1.wp.com/www.hudsonvalleysportsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Looking-Ahead.jpg?w=400&ssl=1)

Get started on that project. Find resources, and contact me if you're not sure how to begin.

During [Week 11](week-11-notes) we will begin the final "unit" in the course and explore a range of issues related to ethics and justice in technical and professional writing. Alongside working on your project we will do introductory dives into the following:
  - copyright and intellectual property
  - the problematic nature of professionalism standards
  - inclusion and language justice
  - balancing the 7Cs
  - accessibility and disability and workplace communication

And probably some other good stuff, too. Buckle up!
