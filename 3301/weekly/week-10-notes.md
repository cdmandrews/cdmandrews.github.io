Keep chomping away at your fact sheets. A few pieces of information for this week:

1. Sharing Documents in Office online

## Tuesday

A common problem area in professional writing is faulty parallel structure. Review the following materials about grammatical parallelism and style in technical and professional writing:

- [Parallel structure](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/parallel_structure.html) (from Purdue OWL)
- [Parallelism in technical communication](https://helenfawcett.com/effective-rhetoric-effective-writing-parallelism-in-technical-communication/) by Helen Fawcett

You should also [refresh on some of the high points of page design we've read and talked about](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/b0b869d2-479c-44aa-b370-25b91e470c42).

As you are drafting and revising your own fact sheet, look specifically for places where you can enhance parallelism, whether in titles, lists, sentences, or other features of your document.

Instead of a discussion in the Week 10 forum, use the **sharing** feature of Word Online to share the current draft of your fact sheet with me. You have two options for doing so:

1. Post a link to your document (please use your university Office Online subscription) to the Week 10 forum. I will use that link to request access to your document.
2. Share your document with me directly using Microsoft Word. If you do not know how to do this, view the video on this page.

Please have your draft shared with me by Tuesday so we can do peer and instructor review for the rest of the week.

Also, if you have a two-column design and Word online is throwing you off, don't freak out. Word online does *not* present columns, but the columns are retained in your documents regardless. A video overview of this issue:

## Thursday

Peer review!

**Group coordinators**, you're on task again. Divide the members of your group (including yourself) into clusters of 3 or 4 people who will be each others' peer reviewers. You may assign groups at random or let everyone self-select, it's up to you and your group and how ya'll do things. Please send this list to me when you've got it finalized.

**Tech writers**, share your fact sheet (again using Office Online) with your two or three peer reviewers (as well as with me--this must be the same file you shared with me earlier in the week) If you are not sure how to share files in Office online, view the video on this page.

Review each others' work. Use Word's commenting and review features to provide peer feedback and commentary. Read each others' fact sheets carefully and generously. Provide at least 5 actionable comments to each writer on any or all of the following areas:
- Writing style (how effectively are the writer's sentences, paragraphs, lists, and words explaining their content?)
- Page design (how effective is the writer's use of white space, overall page alignment, use of color, CRAP principles, and other aspects of page design?)
- Visual elements (Howe effective, appropriate, and rhetorical are visual elements?)

A few things to remember about feedback:
1. It's a draft and we're all learning. Be kind.
2. Everyone's learning at different speeds. Be polite.
3. It's still a freaking pandemic outside. Be generous.
4. Take the opportunity to learn from what others are doing. Be attentive.
5. Give feedback to others as you would have feedback given to you. Give writers specific feedback about particular things. This sentence, this word, this picture, this color. Telling writers "It's great you just have to finish" isn't helpful--they know that already. Offer specific ideas about how and what to revise or finish.

I don't like to wave points around, but some folks don't always take peer review seriously.  Peer review sessions are worth 50 points, and should not be skipped. Peer review is an opportunity to share, learn, and improve your writing--not participating hurts your final product and the final products of others. Do your group a solid and be present for peer review!!

## Looking ahead

Next week is a get. it. done. week. You will not have an assignment for Tuesday. If you want to use that time for an individual consultation, please let me know and we'll get it scheduled.

The fact sheet is due (!) October 29th. Then we'll rest and get set for the second--and final--project.
