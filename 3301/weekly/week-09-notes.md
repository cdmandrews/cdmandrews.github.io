# Overview for Week 9

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

## Big picture

At this point, you really just need to spend time getting research in line for your fact sheets.

It's tempting to start with a template and start filling things in from there--but these should be based on your research and your findings. Do the research. Collect your examples and information for those 10 genres, and go through and make notes about exigence, audience, purpose, key style/design/visual and other rhetorical features, and social, ethical, and justice-oriented aspects of the writing.

Among the important things to do with your fact sheets is to give them a sense of unity and coherence. **There should be a coherent, central, key message to your fact sheets**. Notice that none of the examples we looked at last week were "A Bunch of Random Stuff About X", right? They each had key messages, whether they were instructional, informational, or persuasive.

This week will include a short progress report, and I've put together some of my own notes and examples about fact sheets to go along with yours. Finally, I've prepared a short video about genre, genre sets, and genre ecologies to help you think through your findings.

## Tuesday

Work on that research. No post today. Review my [notes on fact sheets](facts-about-fact-sheets) and continue working on your research.

<mark>If you have questions, please ask them! Lots of questions early on means fewer freak-outs later!</mark>

There is an **optional** activity in the Weeks 8-11 folder on Blackboard for this week. Assignment 09.1 "Styles and Graphical Elements in MSWord" is extra practice for those students interested in an introduction to Word stylesheets and other intermediate features. The instructions for this activity are on Blackboard.

## Thursday

Participate in the "Project 1 Progress Reports" forum thread in your group.

First, skim the following chapter on progress reports: [OTC 2.5 Progress Reports](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/open-technical-communication/section/732cb3dd-26de-4732-a854-4184dd2fae86)

Write a progress report that updates me on your project's status thus far. Write to me as if I'm your manager or funder, not just your instructor. Keep it simple, but provide specific details rather than vague generalizations. To help you learn about structures and features of progress reporting, please [download and use this template](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/archive/progress-report-template.docx).

Upload your document to the Week 09 forum in your group. No discussion necessary, but checking in on your people and giving them cheers and hearty waves is always good!

## Looking ahead

Next week we'll concern ourselves with continued research and revision work, and the first round of peer review on your fact sheets. Move to drafting!
