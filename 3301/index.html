			<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
			<p>English 3301 is an introductory technical writing course designed to help students gain practical experience in finding and interpreting information and writing reports and documents for specialized audiences in the professional world.</p>

			<h2>About the Course</h2>
			<p>Nearly every professional is a technical and professional communicator. Technical and professional communicators work alone and with others to prepare documents and presentations that communicate information within business, government, industry, and the scientific community—really, any workplace setting. We use communication to do things and respond to situations and problems: provide instructions, report on an event or activity, coordinate resources, make recommendations, presentt information on a Web page, report on research and scientific findings, and tons of other stuff.</p>

			<h2>Required Materials</h2>
			<p>We will use a variety of free, open source textbooks for this class; you are not required to purchase a textbook.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em><a href="http://open-tc.com">Open Technical Communication</a></em></li>
				<li><em><a href="https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/">Technical Writing Essentials</a></em></li>
				<li><em><a href="https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/businessandprofessionalwriting/">Business and Professional Writing</a></em></li>
				<li><em><a href="https://scholarworks.uark.edu/oer/4/">Open Technical Writing</a></em></li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Required Technologies</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Basic emailing, web browsing, and word processing skills</li>
				<li>A computer with reliable Internet access and a reliable office software suite. TAMUCC offers students free access to Office 365; visit <a href="https://it.tamucc.edu/Office365/Office365.html">it.tamucc.edu/Office365/Office365.html</a></li>

			</ul>

			<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
			<p>Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create texts (written / visual / multimodal) by using effective and appropriate rhetorical methods and strategies in writing</li>
				<li>Create texts (written / visual / multimodal) by choosing and using appropriate strategies in a variety of genres to achieve specific purposes with specific audiences</li>
				<li>Create texts (written / visual / multimodal) by locating, selecting, assessing, and analyzing information sources, both print and digital, and integrate and document sources appropriately</li>
			</ol>

			<h2 id="projects">Graded Activities</h2>
			<p>Complete descriptions, requirements, evaluation criteria, and rubrics are available on Blackboard. I will use the grading scale as described in the University <em>Catalog</em>.</p>

			</table>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Weekly Activities">Discussions &amp; other application activities</h3>
				<p><em>30% of final grade</em> (Weekly)</p>
				<p>Use group discussion forums, journal entries, and other activities to explore and practice methods, strategies, and principles of technical communication. Generally, these activities will consist of reading, working an exercise or working through a case based on that reading, and working collaboratively with your classmates.</p>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Major Project 1">Major Project 1: High-level overview of writing in your field</h3>
				<p><em>30% of final grade</em> | Due week 11 | <a href="project-1">Full description</a></p>
				<p>Survey the kinds or genres of professional and technical communication individuals in your intended career do. Create a fact sheet and a visualization based on your research. You will provide a short description of each different kind of writing, identify typical audiences and purposes, explore relevant ethical and social justice issues, and classify the kinds of writing, connecting to research and resources as appropriate.</p>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Major Project 2">Major Project 2: Researched product about writing in your field</h3>
				<p><em>30% of final grade</em> | Due week 16 | <a href="project-2">Full description</a></p>
				<p>Select a professional communication topic, problem, or genre that you’d like to expand on from project 1. Take the content knowledge you’ve built about writing in your field and create a piece of professional and technical writing that will help a specific audience learn, do, or make a decision about something. Select an appropriate medium and genre for your audience and purpose and make rhetorical, contextual decisions about what will work best. The final product is very much up to you, and the text you create could take a variety of forms: a formal report, a technical description, an informative website, a tutorial presentation, etc. Regardless of format, your second project should inform, persuade, or instruct your audience about specialized aspects of communication in your field.</p>

				<h3>Drafts &amp; Peer Review</h3>
				<p><em>10% of final grade</em></p>
				<p>Work through drafting and review processes for major projects. Peer review is an opportunity to learn from and with your classmates. We will use these sessions to work with each other’s documents in a supportive and collaborative environment, and to get feedback from your instructor.</p>

			<h2>Course Schedule</h2>
			<p><a href="calendar.html">A detailed weekly schedule </a>of readings and assignments is available on our learning management system (LMS). If changes are necessary, I will announce them via email and the LMS.</p>

			<p>Multiple exercises and discussion activities are due each week, and I’ve scheduled the class roughly as a Tuesday-Thursday (T/R) class. Post discussions and exercises by 5:00 pm on the day they are due.  </p>

			<h2>Course Conduct (OL)</h2>
			<p>This online section of English 3301 has the same expectations as the onsite course and the same amount of work. Please don’t think that because the class is online it will be less rigorous than the face-to-face course. In fact, the course will probably seem more intense as you will be engaging with course material without the communal prodding of an onsite class. However, if you read the instructions all the way through, talk to me and the other people in your group, and give everything an honest effort, you will be successful.</p>

			<p>The most important things you can do to get everything you can out of this course:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Engage with your classmates and your instructor</li>
				<li>Keep up with and “attend” the class</li>
				<li>Understand late work and revision policies</li>
				<li>Practice professional communication in email and other communications</li>
				<li>Learn to use our technology</li>
			</ul>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Engaging">Engage with your classmates and instructor</h3>
				<p>In an online course, interacting with your classmates is just as valuable as interacting with the instructor. For us, discussions and chats are primary modes of learning as well as communication with fellow students. Take advantage of discussions, participate in discussion channels in a timely manner, and actually talk TO EACH OTHER rather than just TO ME. Add your opinions to/participate in the discussions, but do so respectfully of the viewpoints and lived experiences of others.</p>

				<p>Work extra hard to get to know other classmates—they are going through the same material you are, but will bring their diverse experiences to bear on it and you might learn something from them. An online class does not have to be an isolating experience. I will assign you to a discussion group in the course, and you should get to know thoe people. Reach out in Blackboard posts, email, or social media to support each other. If you have good info/tips on what is working for you, on resources, or other ideas, please share with the group so we can help each other out. The class will become its own community of practice, and you will be amazed at how good of a resource your colleagues can be.</p>

				<p class="text-info">FERPA Privacy note: I won’t use any forum other than your university email to ask or talk about grades. Grade discussions are private and should occur with your instructor only.</p>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Attending">Keep up with and “attend” the class</h3>
				<p>There is no synchronous attendance component for this course—posting assignments and exercises as well as participating in discussions on the regular, posted schedule is “attending” class. I expect that you will attend class by logging in 3-4 times per week, checking recent announcements, reading weekly schedules and instructions, and generally keeping up with assigned work and discussions. Work is normally due on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The course is tightly scheduled, so getting behind will make the course seem very intimidating, very quickly.</p>
				<p class="text-info">For purposes of reporting non-attendance to the University during grade reporting, I will use the last day you submitted work and not the last time you logged onto Blackboard.</p>

				<p>In an online class, people inevitably ask me, “What can I do to get ahead?” There are a few parts to this answer:</p>

				<p>ENGL 3301 is a regular college course and not a correspondence course. This course isn’t designed for you to complete assignments entirely at your own pace. The course is intended to be interactive and collaborative, and you’ll learn as much from the other people in your course group and the work you’ll do together as you will from me.</p>

				<p>You may post weekly assignments early, but know that most activities require you to revisit forums and respond to others’ ideas to earn full credit for the task. Do not forget to return at the right time and complete these discussions.</p>

				<p>If you begin assignments early, do so understanding that I’ve organized and scaffolded our weekly activities so that they will help prepare you to complete and be successful on major projects. If you get too far ahead on those, you may end up heading in the wrong direction because you haven’t yet completed a key discussion activity or had a chance to benefit from peer review.</p>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Late work">Understand late work and revision policies</h3>
				<p>Post assignments on time. I am understanding of occasional late work, but this should not be habitual. It is up to you to prioritize learning activities in this class. I don’t assign penalties for late work on regular weekly activities and assignments as long as they are turned in within a three-day grace period. However, the later you submit, the less feedback you will receive.</p>

				<ul class="text-info">
					<li>After a three-day grace period, I will deduct 10% from regular weekly assignments and discussions</li>
					<li>I will not accept major projects more than 5 calendar days late</li>
					<li>The last day to submit late work will be posted in Blackboard</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I am on your side, but you are responsible for you: keep up with your assignments and your grades. I post all grades for you in Blackboard, so all you have to do is regularly check in.</p>

				<p>I accept revisions on major projects, provided that you meet formally with me to discuss feedback on your project, a revision agenda, and a timeline for completion.</p>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Email">Practice professional communication in email</h3>
				<p>Email is an important professional medium, and I assume you will use your university email account for this course.</p>

				<p>As the class is a professional writing course, I expect that you will practice what we’re learning. We will explore this further, but professional email includes a <strong>meaningful</strong> <strong>subject line</strong>, a <strong>complete inquiry</strong>, and uses <strong>language appropriate for the writer’s context</strong>.</p>
				<ul class="text-info">
					<li>Unprofessional emails will result in non-response.</li>
					<li>I will commonly respond to Blackboard or email requests within 24 hours, but you can expect a response within 3 days. I generally do not answer emails over the weekend.</li>
					<li>I will use Announcements on Blackboard each week, which will also send to your Islander email account. You may set up email forwarding if you wish, but you are responsible for checking email. Missing emails is not an excuse for missed work or announcements.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Technology">Learn to use our technology</h3>
				<p>As you might rightly assume, a course titled "Technical and Professional Writing” is entirely imbricated with technology: the class is about technology, you will complete it via technology, and it works because of, as a result of, and in dialogue with technology. This means a handful of things:</p>

				<p>Difficulty with your computer or technology is not an acceptable excuse for late work, whether those are reading responses or major projects. Practice agency by backing up your work, practicing good file management habits, ensuring your technology is updated within your means and the expectations of coursework, and saving early and often.</p>

				<p class="text-info">TAMUCC provides you free access to Office 365, along with a variety of other software. Use these resources! Visit <a href="http://iol.tamucc.edu">http://iol.tamucc.edu</a> for details.</p>

				<p>Ultimately, you are responsible for your command of technology as well as course content. I will help you do this and provide resources to support you, but if you are having difficulty it is your responsibility to a) ask for help and b) look for tutorials and supplementary material that work for you.</p>

			<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>

				<h3>Notice to Students with Disabilities</h3>
				<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. </p>

				<p class="text-info">If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please call or visit Disability Services at (361) 825-5816 in Corpus Christi Hall 116. </p>

				<p class="text-info">If you are a returning veteran and are experiencing cognitive and/or physical access issues in the classroom, or on campus, please contact the Disability Services office for assistance at (361) 825-5816.</p>

				<h3>Statement of Civility</h3>
				<p>Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi has a diverse student population that represents the population of the state. Our goal is to provide you with a high quality educational experience that is free from repression. You are responsible for following the rules of the University, city, state and federal government. We expect that you will behave in a manner that is dignified, respectful and courteous to all people, regardless of sex, ethnic/racial origin, religious background, sexual orientation or disability. Behaviors that infringe on the rights of another individual will not be tolerated.</p>

				<h3>Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty</h3>
				<p>University students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty.  Academic misconduct for which a student is subject to penalty includes all forms of cheating, such as illicit possession of examinations or examination materials, falsification, forgery, complicity or plagiarism. (Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another as one’s own work.)  </p>

				<p>In this class, academic misconduct or complicity in an act of academic misconduct on an assignment or test will result in:</p>
				<ul class="text-info">
					<li>first offense = no credit for assignment</li>
					<li>subsequent offenses = failure of class</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In general terms, students are expected to "demonstrate a high level of maturity, self-direction and ability to manage their own affairs" and to "conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty." Instances of plagiarism will be handled in accordance with Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi General Academic Policies and Regulations as listed in the current catalog.</p>

				<h3>Dropping a Class</h3>
				<p>I hope that you never find it necessary to drop this or any other class.  However, events can sometimes occur that make dropping a course necessary or wise. Please consult with your academic advisor, the Financial Aid Office, and me, before you decide to drop this course.  Should dropping the course be the best course of action, you must initiate the process to drop the course by going to the Student Services Center and filling out a course drop form.  Just stopping attendance and participation WILL NOT automatically result in your being dropped from the class. November 5, 2020, is the last day to drop a class with an automatic grade of “W” this term.</p>

				<h3>Grade Appeal Process</h3>
				<p>As stated in University Procedure 13.02.99.C2.03, Student Grade Appeal Procedures, a student who believes that he or she has not been held to appropriate academic standards as outlined in the class syllabus, equitable evaluation procedures, or appropriate grading, may appeal the final grade given in the course. The burden of proof is upon the student to demonstrate the appropriateness of the appeal.  A student with a complaint about a grade is encouraged to first discuss the matter with the instructor.  For complete details, including the responsibilities of the parties involved in the process and the number of days allowed for completing the steps in the process, see University Procedure 13.02.99.C2.03, Student Grade Appeal Procedures. These documents are accessible through the University Rules Web site at <a href="http://academicaffairs.tamucc.edu/rules_procedures/assets/13.02.99.c0.03_student_grade_appeals.pdf">http://academicaffairs.tamucc.edu/rules_procedures/assets/13.02.99.c0.03_student_grade_appeals.pdf</a> For assistance and/or guidance in the grade appeal process, students may contact the Dean’s office in the college in which the course is taught or the Office of the Provost.</p>

				<h3>Statement of Academic Continuity</h3>
				<p>In the event of an unforeseen adverse event, such as a major hurricane, and classes could not be held on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University–Corpus Christi; this course would continue through the use of Blackboard and/or email. In addition, the syllabus and class activities may be modified to allow continuation of the course. Ideally, University facilities (i.e., emails, web sites, and Blackboard) will be operational within two days of the closing of the physical campus. However, students need to make certain that the course instructor has a primary and a secondary means of contacting each student.</p>

				<h3>Academic Advising</h3>
				<p>The College of Liberal Arts requires that students meet with an Academic Advisor as soon as they are ready to declare a major.  Degree plans are prepared in the CLA Academic Advising Center. The University uses an online Degree Audit system.  Any amendment must be approved by the Department Chair and the Office of the Dean. All courses and requirements specified in the final degree plan audit must be completed before a degree will be granted.  The CLA Academic Advising Office is located in Driftwood 203.  For more information please call 361-825-3466.</p>

			<h2>Online Learning Information</h2>
			<p>Online courses give you a great deal of flexibility, but also require computing, communication, and organization skills that may not be emphasized in face-to-face courses. Online courses emphasize active learning and regular contact with your instructor and other students. Find more information about Online Learning at <a href="http://iol.tamucc.edu">http://iol.tamucc.edu</a></p>
