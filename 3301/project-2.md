# Project 2: Researched product about writing in your field

**Background**

Select a professional communication topic, problem, or genre that you’d like to expand on from Project 1.

Take the content knowledge you’ve built about writing in your field and create a piece of professional and technical communication that will help a specific audience learn, do, or make a decision about something. Select an appropriate medium and genre for your audience and purpose and make rhetorical, contextual decisions about how you will communicate.

Your final product is very much up to you, and the text you create could take a variety of forms: a formal report, a technical description, an informative website, a tutorial presentation, etc. Regardless of format, your second project should apply technical and professional communication strategies to inform, persuade, or instruct your audience <mark>about specialized aspects of communication in your field</mark>.

## Goals

Along with our course SLOs (1, 2, 3) three specific goals for this assignment are:

- Learn about the rhetorical nature of workplace communication
- Practice communicating technical or specialist information to non-specialist audiences
- Practice the writing you will do in the future and create knowledge you can use later in your career

## Options

This project begins with the work you did for your fact sheet and visualizations created for Project 1. Select documents, genres, problems, or issues you learned about that you'd like to study and write about in greater depth. Present your findings in a research-based resource that will help a specific audience learn, do, or make a decision about something.

For instance, you could:

1. Interview and profile a technical and professional communicator in your field about writing and communicating in their work and report on your findings for other students in the major.
2. Write an analytical, evaluative, or research report on a particular genre or rhetorical situation, describing important exigencies, audiences, features, and other rhetorical issues.
5. Create a "Guide to TPC" for a particular field to add to [this course's resources](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/searching-professional-writing.html),  including links to examples and descriptions of audiences, exigencies, and other relevant commentary.
3. Research a contemporary communication problem for your field and write a proposal or feasibility study with recommendations for important stakeholders or decision-makers.
4. Write a series of engaging and informational blog posts about TPW in your field relevant to TAMUCC students.
3. Create a detailed technical description of a particular mechanism, object, process, or genre in your field.
4. Write an instruction set or training presentation relevant to technical and professional communicating in your field.
5. Study [shifting voices and rhetorical strategies in professional writing spaces](https://www.workplace-writing.org/shifting-voice-in-new-writing-spaces-assignment/) ([Archived version if the site isn't working](archive/shifting-voices-archive.pdf))
6. Or, you can **propose your own idea**...

<mark>Students who wish to collaborate on a complex project may do so.</mark>

## Requirements
Yes, I know that's a whole lot of "whatever you want" so far. The following sections describe general requirements for the scope, character, and delivery of your project.

### Content requirements

Ultimately, the resource you create will make a carefully researched set of claims about what you&#39;ve learned about professional writing in your field.

Regardless of which option you select, you should be able to clearly articulate a [specific audience and particular exigence](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/understandingrhetoricalsituation/) for your project. You should also be able to tie the rhetorical choices you've made in developing and presenting that project back to the audiences and purposes you have in mind. - You'll use the introduction section of whatever document you create to clarify its audiences, purposes, and rationales.

All of the above tasks&mdash;whether written reports, presentations, or web documents&mdash; will rely on [research](https://writingcommons.org/section/research/) and factual information to provide the kind of details your specific audience needs. Continue the library and internet research you began for the first project. Review resources in professional and technical communication research, research and articles written by experts in your field about writing and communication, and other sources to help you answer your questions, make recommendations, and inform, persuade, or teach your audiences.

**As an addendum to your project you must also turn in a 2-page [memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/format.html)-formatted message to me in which you do the following**:
  - reflect on and describe your process of developing your project: what you did, what you learned, what was difficult, what successes you had, how you thought about your rhetorical situation, etc.
  - reflect on what you've learned about technical and professional writing over the last 15 weeks.

### Design requirements

For your project:
- **Use headings and subheadings** to make your document more accessible and comprehensible.
- **Include visuals, figures, and illustrations** in your document that will help readers understand your message
- **Use design elements** (such as space, color, layout, and effective paragraphs and lists) to highlight key information, reinforce relationships in your content, and make your document easy to read and visually appealing.
- **Give your document a meaningful subject line/title**. &quot;Recommendation Report&quot; is not a meaningful subject line that suggests something about the content or key message of your document.
- **Format your document to look and work like a professional example of its genre as best as you are able**. A blog post should look and feel like a blog post. A technical report should look and feel like a technical report, etc.
  - *Do not turn in a document with double-spaced, 12pt Times New Roman manuscript formatting or a school-type heading*
- **Include a bibliography or list of references** (APA format preferred, but other reference style systems are acceptable)
- Number of pages? **Long enough to meet the needs of your rhetorical situation**.

For your reflecton memo:
- Use memo format (headers, subject lines, block formatting w/subheads) as we've practiced it in class, designed as you see fit for your rhetorical situation.
- Longer than a single page; 2 pages in length maximum.
