# Project 2: Researched product about writing in your field

**Background**

Select a professional communication topic, problem, or genre that you’d like to expand on from Project 1.

Take the content knowledge you’ve built about writing in your field and create a piece of professional and technical communication that will help a specific audience learn, do, or make a decision about something. Select an appropriate medium and genre for your audience and purpose and make rhetorical, contextual decisions about what will work best.

Your final product is very much up to you, and the text you create could take a variety of forms: a formal report, a technical description, an informative website, a tutorial presentation, etc. Regardless of format, your second project should inform, persuade, or instruct your audience about specialized aspects of communication in your field.

## Goals

Along with our course SLOs (1, 2, 3) three specific goals for this assignment are:

- Learn about the rhetorical nature of workplace communication
- Practice communicating technical or specialist information to non-specialist audiences
- Think about the writing you will do in the future as you create knowledge you can use later in your career

## Options

This project begins with the work you did for your fact sheet and visualizations created for Project 1. Select documents, genres, problems, or issues you learned about that you'd like to study and write about in greater depth. Present your findings in a research-based resource that will help a specific audience learn, do, or make a decision about something.

For instance, you could:

1. Interview and profile a technical and professional communicator in your field about writing and communicating in their work.
2. Write a research report on a particular genre or rhetorical situation, describing important exigencies, audiences, features, and other rhetorical issues.
5. Create a "Guide to TPC" for a particular field to add to [this course's resources](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/searching-professional-writing.html),  including links to examples and descriptions of audiences, exigencies, and other relevant commentary.
3. Research a contemporary communication problem for your field and write a proposal or feasibility study with recommendations for key stakeholders.
4. Write a series of engaging and informational blog posts about TPW in your field relevant to TAMUCC students.
3. Create a detailed technical description of a particular mechanism, object, process, or genre in your field.
4. Write an instruction set or training presentation relevant to technical and professional communicating in your field.
6. Or you can **propose your own idea**...

## Requirements

### Content requirements

Yes, I know that's a whole lot of "whatever you want" up there.

Ultimately, the resource you create will make a carefully researched set of claims about what you&#39;ve learned about professional writing in your field.

Regardless of which option you select, you should be able to clearly articulate a specific audience and particular exigence for your project. You should also be able to tie the rhetorical choices you've made in developing and presenting that project back to the audiences and purposes you have in mind. - You'll use the introduction section of whatever document you create to clarify its audiences, purposes, and rationales.

As an addendum to your project you must also turn in a 2-page memo- or letter-formatted message to me that describes your process of developing your project. You must also reflect on both the project and what you've learned about technical and professional writing over the last 15 weeks.

All of the above tasks&mdash;whether written reports, presentations, or web documents&mdash; will rely on research and factual information to provide the kind of details your specific audience needs. Continue the library and internet research you began for the first project. Review resources in professional and technical communication research, research and articles written by experts in your field about writing and communication, and other sources to help build context for your analysis of the three documents you&#39;ve chosen.

### Design requirements

- **Use headings and subheadings** to make your document more accessible and comprehensible.
- **Include visuals, figures, and illustrations** in your document that will help readers understand your message
- **Use design elements and graphics** (such as space, color, layout) to highlight key information, reinforce relationships in your content, and make your document easy to read and visually appealing.
- **Give your document a meaningful subject line/title**. &quot;Recommendation Report&quot; is not a meaningful subject line that suggests something about the content or key message of your document.
- **Format** your fact sheet to look like a professional example of is genre. A blog post should look like a blog post. A technical report should look like a technical report, etc.
  - *Do not turn in a docuent with double-spaced, 12pt Times New Roman manuscript formatting, a school-type heading, etc.*
- **Include a bibliography or list of**  **references** (APA format preferred, but other formal reference style systems are acceptable)
- Number of pages? **Long enough to meet the needs of the rhetorical situation**.
