ENGL 3301: Technical &amp; Professional Writing

# Project 2: Research Report (Fall 19)

In this project, you will do further research into genres, problems, or issues relevant to professional writing in your field. You will create a formal report that informs readers unfamiliar with that field about your significant findings.

As part of the work of developing this report, you will create a series of other texts, such as a short proposal, a slideshow that presents some of your developing ideas and findings to members of the class, and a cover letter for the report.

## Goals

Along with our course SLOs (1, 2, 3) three specific goals for this assignment are:

- Learn about the rhetorical nature of workplace documents and genres by connecting textual features such as sentence style, visual design, and page layout to audiences, stakeholders, and purposes
- Practice communicating technical or specialist information to non-specialist audiences via a common workplace genre, the report
- Think about the writing you will do in the future as you create knowledge you can use later in your career

## Instructions

This report begins with the documents you described in your reference sheet (Project 1).

Select at least three documents or genres from your reference sheet you&#39;d like to study in greater depth. Working from real examples of those documents, analyze each document&#39;s rhetorical features. Develop your analysis with primary and secondary research about professional writing in your field and by connecting your findings to concepts in professional and technical writing.

Write a report that describes and analyzes the important situations, purposes, audiences, styles, designs, or other rhetorical issues related to those documents. Describe and explain these texts and rhetorical situations for professional writing in your field to someone outside or unfamiliar with that field. (You will develop a more specific audience for your report as we progress.)

Ultimately, your report will make a carefully researched set of claims about what you&#39;ve learned about professional writing in your field. Your report will have a central &quot;key message.&quot; Some possible questions you might answer include: How do writers and readers use these texts get work done? What are important purposes for writing in your field, and how do writers meet them? What makes these texts good professional or technical writing? What ideas or concepts from the course can you see at work in these texts? How are these documents rhetorical in nature? How do writers go about creating these kinds of texts?

## Creating your report

### Select and locate your documents

At least part of your research will be based on your first-hand analysis of examples of professional and technical documents. First, you will need to decide on at least three examples of documents or genres you explored in your reference sheet. Locate **real** examples of those documents to carefully read and analyze.

Forms **will not work** for this assignment; your documents must be real, working instances of documents you might write as a working professional. If you interviewed a professional for the first project, they might be able to provide you with a few documents to work with.

Collect more documents than you need; your analysis will eventually point out the most interesting or telling features of a selection of your documents.

### Analyze your documents

We will complete a series of analytical assignments as part of class work. You&#39;ll also need to do some discovery about the situations, roles, and purposes for writing in your field to help you put your chosen documents or genres into context. I will provide heuristics and other materials during writing workshops to help you analyze and think about your texts.

One goal in your analysis work is to get a sense for how specific textual features such as word choice and sentence style, content and structure, or visual design and page layout are connected to the documents&#39; specific readers, stakeholders, and purposes.

### Do other primary and secondary research

Reports rely on details and factual informationâ€”providing the kind of details your specific audience needs. Continue the library and internet research you began for the first project. Review resources in professional and technical communication research, research and articles written by experts in your field about writing and communication, and other sources to help build context for your analysis of the three documents you&#39;ve chosen.

Ultimately, your report will make a carefully researched set of claims about what you&#39;ve learned about professional writing in your field. Your report will have a central &quot;key message.&quot; Some possible questions you might answer include: How do writers and readers use these texts get work done? What are important purposes for writing in your field, and how do writers meet them? What makes these texts good professional or technical writing? What ideas or concepts from the course can you see at work in these texts? How are these documents rhetorical in nature? How do writers go about creating these kinds of texts?

### Create your report

As a result of activities and workshops in class, you will have defined the following:

- _Report topic:_ Define the subject you are going to write on, narrowed as much as possible. Define the key message of the report.
- _Report audience:_ Define a specific person or group of people for whom you are going to write the report. Define the circumstances in which this report is needed.
- _Report purpose:_ Define what the report will accomplish--what needs of the audience it is going to fulfill. What will audience members DO with the information you&#39;ve put together?
- _Report type:_ Decide on the type of report. Some options we&#39;ll discuss:
  - technical background report
  - feasibility report
  - recommendation report
  - technical specifications
  - report-length proposal
  - instructions
  - something else?

Use a formal report format to share your results (see _ETC_ Chapter 8). You&#39;ll create headings and subheadings to make your document more accessible and comprehensible, highlighting divisions and topics within the body of your document. You should also have visuals, figures, or illustrations of some kind in your document as appropriate to your specific audience and purpose. Also, give your report a meaningful title. &quot;Research Report&quot; is not a meaningful title that suggests something about the content or key message of your report.

Include at least the following major sections in your report:

1. Executive Summary OR Cover Letter
2. Introduction
3. Discussion of findings (may be made up of a variety of different sections, such as discussion of research methods, analysis of results, interpretation, etc.)
4. Conclusion
5. References (APA format preferred, but other formal reference style systems are acceptable)

Optional elements for your report might include:

- Acknowledgments
- Table of contents
- List of illustrations
- Glossary/list of symbols
- Appendices

# Project 2: Recommendation Report (Revised during COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns in spring 20)

Select one or more of the documents you described in your reference sheet (Project 1). Analyze and evaluate the document according to your understanding of &quot;good professional writing.&quot;

Write a recommendation report that 1) describes criteria for good professional writing in your field, 2) applies those criteria to evaluate the content and design of the document you&#39;ve chosen, and 3) recommends revisions based on your analysis that will make the document better (More ethical? More effective? More \_\_\_\_?). Your audience will be the organization, company, or persons responsible for the document you are evaluating.

As part of the work of developing this report, you will create a series of other texts, such as a progress report, a short analytical memo, a slideshow that presents some of your developing ideas and findings to members of the class, and a letter of transmittal.

## Goals

Along with our course SLOs (1, 2, 3) three specific goals for this assignment are:

- Learn about the rhetorical nature of workplace documents and genres by connecting textual features such as sentence style, visual design, and page layout to audiences, stakeholders, and purposes
- Practice communicating technical or specialist information to non-specialist audiences via a common workplace genre, the report
- Think about the writing you will do in the future as you create knowledge you can use later in your career

## Instructions

Select one or more of the documents you described in your reference sheet (Project 1). Working from the document, you&#39;ll complete a series of smaller assignments to help you analyze and evaluate its rhetorical features, all of which will build towards the final recommendation report.

Support your evaluation and specific recommendations with research and connect your findings to concepts in professional and technical writing. In particular, you will need to develop criteria for &quot;good professional writing&quot; that you will ultimately apply to your document and recommend changes.

You have a few immediate tasks to begin developing content for your report:

- Select a document that you&#39;ll be able to analyze and recommend revisions to.
- Select and describe criteria for good professional writing in your field.
- Consider the audience and purpose for your report

### Select a document worth analyzing

Your document needs to be one you have access to already, not something you&#39;ll need to spend a lot of time tracking down. I have a few documents I can suggest for students who don&#39;t immediately have something to use.

The document you analyze doesn&#39;t have to be awfulâ€”it just needs to be something you can make legitimate suggestions for improving.

We will complete a series of analytical assignments as part of class work. You&#39;ll also do additional discovery about the situations, roles, and purposes for writing in your field to help you put your chosen document or genre into context. I will provide heuristics and other materials to help you analyze and think about your texts.

One goal in your analysis work is to get a sense for how specific textual features such as word choice and sentence style, content and structure, or visual design and page layout are connected to the documents&#39; specific readers, stakeholders, and purposes.

### Develop criteria for your evaluation

Make use of the many texts we&#39;ve read and the material you&#39;ve collected on your own throughout the semester as you define and explain your criteria to your readers.

For your report, develop 3-5 solid criteria for &quot;good professional and technical writing&quot; that you see as most important or relevant to your field.

Reports rely on details, factual information, and expert opinions or theoriesâ€”providing the kind of details and substantive discussion your specific audience needs to make a decision or understand a rationale. Continue the library and internet research you began for the first project. Review resources in professional and technical communication, research and articles written by experts in your field about writing and communication, and other sources to help build your analysis, criteria, and recommendations.

### Consider your audience and purpose

Your audience will be the organization, company, or persons responsible for the document you are evaluating. (You do NOT have to actually send the recommendation report to that audience.) You&#39;re offering unsolicited recommendations to improve a document that already exists, which presents a variety of challenges.

You&#39;ll need to think about the needs, background knowledge, and other characteristics of your audience. Also, you&#39;ll need to come up with a convincing rationale for your report: why should they do what you&#39;re suggesting? You&#39;ll also have to consider their knowledge of professional and technical writing concepts and practices: what do they (not) know about the subject and concepts you&#39;re talking about and what will you need to do to ensure they understand?

## Requirements for your report

For this project you&#39;ll write a relatively common type of report, a _recommendation report_ that categorizes and analyzes information in order to recommend action based on conclusions. Read and refer to _ETC_ Chapter 8, &quot;Technical Reports,&quot; frequently as you&#39;re planning, organizing, and developing your report. We&#39;ll also use material from this [_Open Technical Communication_ module on recommendation and feasibility reports.](https://softchalkcloud.com/lesson/serve/3eGFUPbWuwTLHn/html)

Because your report is an _unsolicited_ recommendation, you&#39;ll need to explain your rationale, criteria, and analysis clearly and persuasively. You can&#39;t just assume your audience will go for it because you say so. Use evidence, explanations, and a professional tone that will convince your audience that you know what you&#39;re talking about and that your suggestions are in their best interest.

Some requirements:

- **Use an informal or &quot;memo&quot; report format to share your results** (see Chapter 8 in ETC). How reports are developed varies, but it&#39;s likely that you&#39;ll include at least the following main sections:
  - Introduction
  - Criteria or Requirements sections
  - Discussion, Comparison, or Analysis sections
  - Conclusions
  - Recommendations
  - The usual memo/informal report headings (_ETC_ 159-160)
- **Explain 3-5 specific criteria** for &quot;good technical writing&quot; to an audience of non-technical writers
- **Explain specific recommendations** for revising the document so that your audience can make changes.
- **Use headings and subheadings** to make your document more accessible and comprehensible.
- **Include visuals, figures, or illustrations** in your document that will help readers understand your analysis
- **Design your report for readability.** _ **Do not** _ turn in a double-spaced, 12 pt. Times New Roman &quot;school paper.&quot;
- **Give your report a meaningful subject line/title**. &quot;Recommendation Report&quot; is not a meaningful subject line that suggests something about the content or key message of your report.
- **Include a bibliography or list of**  **references** (APA format preferred, but other formal reference style systems are acceptable)
- # of pages? **Long enough**.
