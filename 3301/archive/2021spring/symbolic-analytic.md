## Technical Communication and the Symbolic-Analytic Worker

In ["Relocating the Value of Work: Technical Communication in a Post-Industrial Age" (1996)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047281616641927) Miles Kimball (a tech comm professor at Rennsaeler Polytechnical) describes

"symbolic-analytic work" is part of working in information spaces rather than industrial spaces. SAWs are "highly skilled in information manipulation and abstration, critical and much-sought after skills in an age where information overtakes industry in terms of social and economic value"(p. 253).

SAWs:
  - possess the abilities to identify, rearrange, circulate, abstract, and broker information
  - prinicipal
