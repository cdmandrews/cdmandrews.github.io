# Notes and Overview for Week 16
[ENGL 3301, Fall 2021](../calendar.html)

Just that one, last writing activity: your **Final Debrief**.

## Final Debrief due Tuesday, May 11.

1. **Collect 6 or more pieces of *evidence of your growth as a technical, professional writer this semester*.** Your evidence should be **screenshots or excerpts of pieces of writing you've done for this course**. You may draw from anything you've written or created for our class over the course of the semester: your major projects, rough drafts of projects, discussion forums you participated in with your group, emails and chats about the course, or assignments/documents/powerpoints/images and other "stuff" you made along the way. Anything that you think is good evidence of you as a tech/prof writer. As you are selecting evidence, you have two possible approaches to choose from, and either option is acceptable:
  - <span style="color: green; ">**Option 1: How far I came.** Select evidence for your portfolio that helps tell a story of your growth, development, or change as a writer over the last fifteen weeks.</span>
  - <span style="color: dodgerblue; ">**Option 2: The best of my best.** Select evidence for your portfolio that you feel represents your best, most representative work in the course.</span>

2. **Open your debrief by reflecting on and articulating your definition of technical communication/writing and your role as a technical writer.** How did you understand it at the beginning of the course? How do you understand it now? Can you develop a stabilized-for-now understanding of technical writing that will be useful for you going forward in the future? How might this (re)definition of technical writing be useful to you in the immediate present and in your future as a professional who will inevitably write? Sources are nice, but I really want to know what YOU have to say.

3. **In the body of your reflection, present and discuss "what you've learned."** This part is all about YOU. That is, reflect on your work in the course--what have been the most important concepts for you? What are the important strategies, techniques, or theories that you've learned, and how do you plan on taking those forward into the future? This is also the section where you'll present your evidence--those screenshots, links, or short excerpts from previous writings, reflecting on them either as part of your progress narrative or your best works narrative. Be sure to explain why you chose them and what you are trying to show with those six pieces of evidence. Please label and caption all pictures, as good professional writers know they should!

4. **End it. Say whatever you want to close it out.** The most important thing in this assignment is to be honest--with yourself, and with me.

### Requirements

How long should it be? **Long enough to get the job done**. Seriously, there is no word count or min/max page length requirement. Just write.

Turn in your reflection **in the medium and format that best supports your purpose for this assignment**: this could be a memo or letter to me, a powerpoint, a short video, or something else I haven't thought of. I will not be grading on style, grammar, spelling, or any of that stuff. Just try to communicate effectively with me! <mark>The only way to fail this assignment is to not do it</mark>. The most important part is that you reflect on what you've done, what it means, and how it's going to play out in your future.

## Looking ahead

You did it! It's done! Thanks for an excellent semester, especially for showing a great deal of resilience and a ton of grace under pressure. This class is normally online and I'm used to teaching it that way, but I also know there's been absolutely nothing normal about this semester. Heck, I've had to get up twice while writing this short paragraph to make sure my 7th grader is on task in her Zoom class. So, yeah--this semester was hard in ways that semesters aren't usually hard. Some of us have done just fine, and others have juuuust scraped through by the skin of our knuckles, and we probably all are feeling pretty rattled at this moment. But know this: **if you're reading this, you made it!**

Thank y'all for sticking it out in a weird, sometimes delightful, sometimes terrible term. We got this.
