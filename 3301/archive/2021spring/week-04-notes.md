# Notes and Overview for Week 4
[ENGL 3301, Fall 2021](../calendar.html)

All work for this week has been rescheduled for next week. Check the course calendar for other changes. Basically, I've rescheduled all assignments for the next few weeks out by one week; otherwise, we're going to pick up in [Week 5](week-05-notes) precisely where we left off.)
