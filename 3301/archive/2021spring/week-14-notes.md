# Notes and Overview for Week 14
[ENGL 3301, Fall 2021](../calendar.html)

Let's just finish up those final projects, eh!

~**Check back in this space on Monday or Tuesday for updates**; I'll post a "here's what I saw" video reviewing what I saw in everyone's drafts and give you some general feedback that I think most folks will find useful. Otherwise, keep writing.~

In the video below (this is a private video, not on YouTube, as it contains some examples of student work), I talk about and point to some examples of three things that all of the strongest drafts thus far have done:

1. The document has a sense of audience and purpose. Who are you writing to? What are they gonna do with your report?
2. Key messages are indicated in the introduction and subheadings.
3. Important terms, concepts, characteristics, or criteria are defined and established early on in the text.

## For Tuesday

Nothing. Work on your report. Schedule an appointment with me. Eat healthy.

## For Thursday

Post a revised, updated draft of your project for peer and instructor review to your group's "14.2: Another project 2 draft review" discussion forum. Same deal as last time: provide some **actionable** suggestions, and I will post video feedback as well.

## Looking ahead

[Week 15](week-15-notes) is when we turn in project 2. I will also go over the reflective portfolio that you'll turn in for finals week.
