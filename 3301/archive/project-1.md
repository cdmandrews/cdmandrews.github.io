ENGL 3301: Technical &amp; Professional Writing

# Project 1: Reference Sheet on Writing in Your Field

**Background**

The major projects in this course are designed to introduce the kinds of writing typical in your discipline or intended profession. You will research common genres that people write in your field, analyze samples, and write about the rhetorical situations and genre features that distinguish them from other kinds of writing (particularly features distinguishing them from academic prose or school writing). You will also practice features, genres, and styles common to technical and professional writing situations.

Some of you are already working in or have experience in your fields, and this series of projects will serve as an opportunity for you to &quot;go deep&quot; on what you&#39;ve already been introduced to and to hone key writing and research skills. For others, the projects will serve as an introduction or awakening to the realities of writing at work and how it may resemble or differ from writing at school.

In this project, you will survey the kinds of writing individuals in your intended career do and arrange the information in a reference sheet. Provide a short description of each different kind of writing, identify typical audiences and purposes, and classify the kinds of writing, connecting the items to the chapters in our textbook and resources online.

You will eventually take the information from this project into the next piece of writing, the genre analysis report, where you will more extensively analyze and compare the writing styles of a few selected genres.

## Goals

Along with our basic course SLOs (1, 2, 3) our specific goals with this assignment are:

- Practice balancing clarity and concision as you try to describe genres both completely and succinctly for an audience using text and visuals.
- Practice information and document design as you try to organize your findings in a way that suggests meaningful connections for an audience.
- Research to learn the variety of written genres and rhetorical situations you might encounter in the workplace.
- Identify ethical issues relevant to writing in your field.

## Instructions

Research to discover the kinds (or genres) of writing that individuals in your intended career do. Arrange your information in a reference sheet that summarizes your findings about **10 different kinds (genres) of writing**.

**Content Requirements:**

You must identify at least the following components:

- Short descriptions of 10 different kinds/genres of professional and technical writing in a particular career, job, or field
- Specific readers for each kind of writing
- Specific purposes for each kind of writing
- Special features or characteristics distinctive to each kind of writing
- Ethical issues or dilemmas relevant to the professionals creating the writing
- Connect or link the kinds of writing to information you&#39;ve learned in our textbook and resources online.
- You may include other information you find interesting or relevant in your reference sheet

**Design Requirements:**

You must meet the following design constraints. Your design should help readers use and understand your document and should suggest meaningful connections in the content:

- **Classify** the kinds of writing you discover, placing them into groups or categories (or otherwise showing relationships between the genres).
- **Use design** elements (such as headings, color, layout) and graphics to highlight key information, reinforce relationships in your content, and make your table easy to read and visually appealing.
- **Format** your document so that it fits on a single &quot;page&quot; in Word. I will show you how to do this.
- **Proofread** your table; your work should be free from all surface errors.

Think of the audience for this project as yourself or someone else thinking about entering the same career field.

You will eventually take the information from this project into the next piece of writing, a research report, where you will more extensively analyze and compare the writing styles of a few selected texts.

## Creating your document

### Step 1: Decide on a career you will focus on for the project

To begin, you must decide on a career field, major, or job that you are interested in. You can choose any career you like. You could also focus on a career related to a job or internship you have had. This should be a professional career that involves professional and technical communication.

### Step 2: Research writing in that career or field

Research the kinds of writing individuals in your chosen career field do and come up with a list that is as comprehensive as possible. Your list will encompass all sorts of writing, from everyday to infrequent, from informal to formal. Don&#39;t overlook social media, as that has become an important venue for technical and professional writing in the 21st century.

Your chart must be the result of **research** , not generalizations you can come up with off the top of your head. You can locate information about writing through a variety of activities:

- interview working professionals
- research in the university library (the library most likely has books about writing in your field)
- research on the Internet (check resources created by professional organizations in your field, government organizations and nonprofits, as well as [trade periodicals and websites](https://youtu.be/ODk6My5y1WA))
- research in academic databases and journals
- examine field [style guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide)

### Step 3: Create your document

You&#39;ll create your project as a table using MS Word. MS Word is free to TAMUCC students via [Office 365](http://it.tamucc.edu/Office365/Office365.html). Do not use Excel or Google Drive because formatting options are limited in those tools.

(_Honestly, I can imagine other ideas for your reference sheet, such as an infographic or poster-style document. If you&#39;d like to_ _ **propose** _ _something a little different that will deliver the same kind of content, please write me a short proposal!)_

We will complete assignments and tutorials to help you get used to functions in Word that will help you create your project. We will also have a series of peer review sessions using your group forums and journals where you will get feedback from myself and your classmates that you can apply as you work.

I will share sample reference sheets for you to examine on Blackboard, but you should strive to make your document **your own**. Rather than make something that is mostly a copy of one of the examples, be creative as you apply concepts we&#39;ve discussed related to helpful designs, usable illustrations, and readable prose.

See the checklists on page 2 section of this document to make sure you&#39;re including useful (and required) content.

Writers of all abilities and experience levels can benefit from appointments with a Writing Consultant in the [CASA Writing Center](http://casa.tamucc.edu/wc.php). Formatting, spelling, and grammatical errors can make your chart difficult to read and understand or can undermine your content.
