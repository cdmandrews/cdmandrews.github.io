# Overview for Week 16

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](calendar.html)

## Big picture

This is the finish! Your final project is due and you may turn it in any time between Tuesday, December 1 and **Saturday, December 5**. Turn it in via the format that makes most sense: that might be a Word document, a PDF, a link to a website, a PowerPoint, or something else.

Turn in your reflective memo in with your final project, either as a separate file or as a cover letter in the same file, depending on the style and medium of your project. Yes, you can upload multiple files with a single submission to Blackboard.

### Guidelines for the reflection memo

Reflection is an important component of learning. This memo is a final and intentional opportunity for you to reflect and debrief on the course. It’s a chance to connect the dots between what we’ve done, what we’ve said, what we’ve made, and what we’ve read.

Write a memo, addressed to me. This memo should be 1-2 pages in length and use memo format: headers, subject lines, block formatting w/subheadings, opening summary/purpose statements, specific content; make rhetorical choices for type, page design, and other elements. You have two major tasks in this memo:

1. Describe and reflect on your process for developing your project: what you did, what you learned, what was difficult, what successes you had, how you thought about your rhetorical situation, and other issues that seem relevant.
1. Reflect on what you’ve learned about TPW over the last 15 weeks. You might go back and peek at your discussion forum posts from weeks 1, 2, and 8. Talk about what you learned in this class, what you struggled with, and what you succeeded at. How will you apply lessons learned from this course in the future–whether future coursework, careers and the job market, or community work?

Turn your memo in with your final project, either as a separate file or as a cover letter in the same file, depending on the style and medium of your project. Yes, you can upload multiple files with a single submission to Blackboard.

## Looking ahead

You did it! Thanks for an excellent semester, especially for showing a great deal of resilience and a ton of grace under pressure. This class is normally online, but I know there's been absolutely nothing normal about this semester. Heck, I've had to get up twice while writing this short paragraph to make sure my 7th grader is on task in her Zoom class. So, yeah--this semester was hard in ways that semesters aren't usually hard, and I've been teaching online for a long time now. Some of us have done just fine, and others have juuuust scraped through by the skin of our knuckles, and we probably all are feeling pretty rattled at this moment. But know this: **if you're reading this, you made it!** Take a breath, take a nap, and dig around in the last of those Thanksgiving leftovers.

Thanks, y'all for sticking it out in a weird, sometimes delightful, sometimes terrible term. We got this.
