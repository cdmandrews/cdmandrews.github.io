# Overview for Week 11

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](calendar.html)

## Big picture
Time to finish up those fact sheets. Work with commentary you've gotten from your instructor and your peers as you wrap those up.

Some key concerns to attend to as you're revising:
1. Consider the key messages or big takeaways for your fact sheets. They shouldn't be info-dumps with unstructured content arranged for no reason other than that's how you put it down. Structure your content to help your readers learn, understand, or do something. (In this case, to help them come to understand some significant information about professional writing in that career or job)
2. This isn't a document design class, so I won't ding you on simple designs. What I am looking for is a usable design that helps readers understand and sift through the information you're presenting.
3. Don't hold back on a draft because you think it's awful or incomplete. Better to get feedback and know what to do to move forward than to get stuck!

## For Tuesday
Nothing due today.

If you need to schedule a conference with me, please do so sooner rather than later before my schedule fills up!

## For Thursday

Your fact sheets and visualizations (whether one file or two) are due today at 5:00 pm. Upload all of your final files to the “Project 1: High-level overview of writing in your field” assignment on Blackboard.

## Looking ahead

Start familiarizing yourself with the [second and final project description](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-2). You may complete this one individually or in small groups--that's entirely up to you.

For this assignment, you've got lots of options for what you might do, but we're still working under the umbrella of applying technical and professional communication strategies to inform, persuade, or instruct your audience **about specialized aspects of communication in your field**. I list some ideas for you on the project description, and one of the first things we'll do is write short proposals about what you're thinking of doing.
