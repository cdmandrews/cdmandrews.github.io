# Notes and Overview for Week 6

## Pics or it didn't happen
Humans are incredibly visual creatures. Look at any Instagram account and you will see evidence that we are able to communicate rich, specific information in an incredibly short time with a picture. (Insert that cliché we all know about a thousand words here.) Another of the important characteristics of technical communication is that it consists of words or images or both. Because readers [respond to visuals](https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/10/03/learning-how-to-communicate-visually-in-documentation/)--often before they check out the text itself--understanding how images and text work together to help readers [understand complex information](https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/10/03/learning-how-to-communicate-visually-in-documentation/) is an increasingly valuable skill for professional communicators.

As your readings made clear, professional communicators often rely on  **illustrations**  along with or instead of words to convey our messages. We can break illustrations into two categories:  **tables**  and  **figures**. Depending on your academic background, you may or may not have a lot of experience working with tables and figures, but as professional writers, alternate methods of presenting data and information are valuable. You must be able to decide when to use an illustration and evaluate whether or not your illustration will be effective.

## General guidelines for writing with visuals

This slideshow hits some important high points and examples, but shouldn't stand in place of reading the above chapters, hint, hint:

Think back to that "Know" photograph in the Ready Corpus Christi hurricane preparedness flier a few weeks ago. I look at it, and it's kind of weird: it was a good quality photo, and while it was thematically relevant, it didn't fit the brief, informative purpose of the document. Students always point out to me (and I agree) that the photo takes up too much space on the page; that space might have been better used by giving more information about emergency routes or the ReverseAlert system.

Graphics are important in technical communication, and one of the things I like about doing tech writing is that we use lots of graphics: drawings, charts, tables, bar charts, and on and on and on. You know the drill at this point if you read the assigned chapters. Purpose and audience, right? Remember that in most cases (unless you're working on a solely visual genre as a graphic designer) you're clarifying, illustrating, and augmenting the written text, not completely replacing it. Use both words and images to make your tech writing useful and usable by your audiences!

I'm not going to go on at length in this text-lecture about graphics--it's mostly all been said by now--but I will point you to some useful resources for working with graphics in your word processors:

### Adding different kinds of graphics to your Word documentation

The following video tutorials walk through different kinds of visuals/graphics and introduce features in Microsoft Word for working with them. (Remember: each of you has access to Office 365 through the university AND a number of free downloads of the Office suite for your computer. Take advantage of these tools!)

**Word: Tables**

Finally, one last reminder that I'll pull from one of the chapters, from David McMurrey:

"Use graphics whenever they would normally be necessary—don't wimp out because it seems like too much trouble! **But at the same time, don't get hung up about creating perfect graphics (scans and photocopies work just fine for our purposes as long as you cite your source). This course is a writing course, not a graphic-arts course**."


## For Tuesday

Participate in your group's "Communicating with visuals" forum according to the prompt below:

1. Analyze and discuss different types of illustrations in this EPA document, [Tackling Bed Bugs: A Starter Guide for Local Government](http://npic.orst.edu/pest/bedbug/tacklingbbstarterguide.pdf). Citing concepts from your readings, evaluate the effectiveness of the guide's visuals:
  - What is the document's specific purpose and specific audience? (Hint: It is NOT the "general public" or "people who have bedbugs in their houses.")
  - What different types of illustrations are included, and what are the writers trying to show with these different visualizations?
  - How effective are illustrations in the document? That is, are tables and figures well-suited to the document's purpose and audience? What are the illustrations there to *do*?
  - Which illustrations are informative, and which are decorative?
  - What do you notice about the creator's methods of numbering, labeling, and citation? Which guidelines in your readings do they follow?

2. Reply and respond to your group member's posts over the course of the week. Do you concur with their evaluation?
3. What other questions do you have about this week's materials?

## For Thursday

Continue working on your researching skills and finish the "Power Searching with Google" course. For this Thursday, complete the following:
 - Complete Units 4, 5, and 6. Do all unit activities except for the embedded discussion forum posts.
 - Complete the post-course assessment
 - Take a screenshot of your post-course assessment when you have successfully completed it.

Finally, write a memo and upload it to this Power Searching assignment. In it, do the following:
  - Use memo format, and address it to me, your professor.
  - Include subheadings in your memo.
  - Block format, please. Single-space, left-aligned, a single line between paragraphs, etc.
  - Contents of your memo:
      1. Summarize what new things you have learned about power searching. (No shorter than 150 words)
      2. Describe strategies you might use for finding examples of professional writing *from your field*. The upcoming major projects will ask you to use all your primary research skills to locate examples of professional writing to analyze and report on, so thinking about these strategies ahead of time will be useful.
        - In fact, let’s go ahead and give it a go: **Find three examples of technical or professional writing from your field online**. These could be reports, brochures, instructions, correspondence, fact sheets, or anything you can think of, as long as it’s *specific to your field*.
      3. In your document, create a table to present information about your examples. Your table should include at least the following: the name of the organization the example comes from (i.e. its sponsor), information about the web site where you found it, what genre it’s an example of, and a hyperlink to the example. *Include appropriate column or row headings and a label/title, according to what you’ve read this week*.
      4. Finally, paste a screenshot of your post-course assessment in your document. *Label and caption your screenshot appropriately, according to what you’ve read this week*.

# Looking ahead

[Week 7](week-07-notes) marks the end of the first unit of the course. In Weeks 1 through 6, you've gotten a rapid-fire introduction to primary strategies, elements, and approaches to technical and professional writing. It was quick and dirty, I know! Don't worry--through the next two units of the course, we'll return to these ideas, refine them and look at examples in your fields, that will help you put them into action.

Next week, you will zoom out and think broadly again about what technical and professional writing/communication is all about and how some of the things you've learned apply to the kinds of writing you see yourself doing 'out there' in the professional world.

As you'll remember from [the syllabus](../index.html), there's no mid-term exam in the course. Next week's discussion is basically your mid-term, so bring your best efforts to bear.
