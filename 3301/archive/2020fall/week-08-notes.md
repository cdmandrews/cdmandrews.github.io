# Overview for Week 8

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](calendar.html)

## Big picture

Before you do anything else this week, your group needs to have done two things. There's a "Group X Whatever forum" in your group area, and you can deliberate there if you don't have another means of communication you're using.

**Task 1**: Pick a group name. Rather than having myself select names for each group, I'd like you to select a name for yourselves. (Because honestly, once it gets out that a group got named "House Stark" you'd all know I'm playing favorites!) Pick whatever kind of name you like; ideally, one that fits the particular character or makeup of your group. My only constraints are that 1) everyone agree, and 2) your group's name begin with the letter that's already used to identify your group (Group A, B, C, D, or E.)

**Task 2**. Elect or select a **coordinator**. This is a light duty job, but best suited to people who 1) aren't afraid to email folks,  2) usually post assignments early rather than later in the week, and 3) are very good at self-starting. The coordinator will have a specific job helping the group get organized on weekly assignments in weeks to come (starting Week 08) as we shift to some different kinds of collaboration.

  - &quot;Genre in the wild: Understanding genre within rhetorical (eco)systems.&quot; from _SLCC Open English_.

A **genre**, as you'll read this week, is a useful concept for talking about texts because it reminds us that texts are **conventional**. Genres often have more-or-less followable &quot;rules&quot; we can use when creating particular genres, but those conventions are not stable-for-all-times-and-places.

As you'll remember when I introduced the term a few weeks ago, in TPW a "genre” refers to a typical way of organizing, presenting, and using language in situations that recur–or repeat–over time. Some examples before returning to a working definition:

- A complaint letter
- An insurance claim
- A job description
- A legal brief
- A proposal
- A syllabus
- A receipt or a bill-of-sale
- A restaurant menu
- A to-do list

In every one of the examples above, you can pretty easily imagine who uses the text, where, when, and for what purposes. A job description is created by a company to advertise a particular position and/or to outline the responsibilities for the person applying/hired. It is either an official document (when used for an employee) or it is a tool used to hire somebody (both company/organization and potential candidates use the description to decide if a person is qualified).

In other words, genres are really **texts-in-use**, or **texts that facilitate achieving some kind of purpose or goal for people**. They are not just descriptions–they are actions. So while it is tempting to think of the forms you fill out at the doctor’s office describing recent symptoms as just a simple text or a piece of writing, when we really study writing, we have to think about how that piece of writing facilitates the doctor-patient relationship. Genres happen in and because of social contexts.

Knowing who uses a text and why they use it helps us to figure out what the content of a piece of writing needs to be as well as how to present that content. Consider the job description again: It typically begins with an overview of the job as well as minimum qualifications. Why does it begin there? Why isn’t this information at the end, or in the middle somewhere? The overview acts as a kind of advertisement; it is there to attract candidates to the position. But the minimum qualifications quickly help candidates to consider whether or not they should apply and what parts of their resume or experience to highly when they do –which in turn saves the company extra work identifying people who do not qualify. In that sense, the minimum qualifications help both the job searcher and the company work more efficiently.

But, some of you might be thinking, sometimes the minimum qualifications are found later in the job description. That is true. Can you imagine a reason for that? If so, you have identified another important principle that applies to genres: **genres often have typical features and designs, but genres aren’t formulas**. In other words, there is not one, eternal, exact way to write them. Instead, genres are governed by **conventions**. We can speak generally about how to write any given genre, but there are always going to be exceptions based in specific communities and organizations that circulate genres. This is why adopting a curious attitude about writing, instead of simply looking for the “right way” to write something, will serve you better as a professional. It will also help alleviate frustration when what you thought was the “right way” to write something ends up requiring editing or modification.

Table 1 below shows some of the most common [genres we talk about in technical communication](https://genreacrossborders.org/research/technical-communication). Of course, there are many, many others specific to particular professions, communities, and organizations. And as you dig into the first project, you will discover all sorts of nooks and crannies that fit here or that push the boundaries of the table.

Table 1: Genres in TPW

| Basic Genres of TPW | But really we're talking specific genres like: |
|---|---|
| Correspondence | Letters, Memos, Email, Text Messages, Instant messaging, Social media posts |
| Reports | Technical reports, Progress reports, Recommendation reports, Feasibility reports, Research reports, Laboratory reports, Oral reports |
| Proposals | Grant proposals, White papers, Internal & External proposals, Solicited & Unsolicited proposals, Requests for proposals |
| Manuals | Product manuals, User manuals, Operations manuals, other kinds of manuals... |
| Stuff that doesn't quite fit in those categories | Meeting minutes, Resumes, Policies and Procedures, Blogs, Website copy, MIssion/Purpose statements, Forms of many different kinds, Statements of many different kinds, Stuff that's super-specific to fields and workplaces, |
| And there's even more that I couldn't list here... |  See other concepts, like: 1) Swales 2004, "constellations of genres"; 2) Bazerman 1994, genre systems, "interrelated genres that interact with each other in specific settings" |

## For Tuesday

Participate in the &quot;Project 1 Q&amp;A&quot; forum thread in your group:

  1. The first of two major course projects is a high-level overview of writing in your field. That's a fancy way of saying you're going to make a fact sheet, including at least one informational visual. For today&#39;s post, you will locate relevant information about this project, assess the task, and make/describe your plan for completing it.
  2. Before you write your response to this post, you should review the [project description for Project 1](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-1).
  3. Post a reply to the &quot;Project 1 Q&amp;A&quot; discussion thread about your understanding of the first major project. Write about your understanding of the assignment, and any questions you have about it. In your post, link to or mention two resources OTHER THAN a search engine where you might look for documents or resources.
  4. Return to this thread later in the week. Review your group members&#39; responses and then go back to edit your original post. See if what others have written helps you answer your question. Try to answer questions posted by your fellow students!
  5. **You must discuss and respond to each others' questions and threads to get full credit on this one. I will, too. Interactivity is the whole point.**

## For Thursday

Participate in the "Fact sheets examples and analysis" forum thread in your group.

This discussion activity will be collaborative. So that you get the benefit of everyone's eyes on a lot of different things, each person in your group should review different examples. Your group will need to get organized before doing this discussion, and the group **coordinator** (see the top of this page) will help the group either choose or assign which fact sheets different folks will look at.

1. Review the list of example fact sheets I've shared via the [project description page](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/project-1#fact-sheets-and-infographics-from-around-the-web). Each person in your group should review three *different* fact sheets. Group coordinators should [download and use this document to help assign or coordinate volunteers](https://cdmandrews.github.io/3301/archive/factsheet-grouplist.docx).

2. Individually, you'll analyze your three fact sheets. For each one, summarize the following information (nested lists or a table would seem to work best for this):
  - What's the title or subject?
  - Who's using it and why? What company or organization created the fact sheet, and what is the fact sheet's specific audience(s)? What actions is it helping the users to take?
  - What are key features of each fact sheet? Look at its *design features* (headings, lists, colors, type, paragraphing, and white space), *use of visuals* (pictures, tables, charts), and *writing style* (long sentences or short? technical language or simple? tone?)
  - **The individual analysis part of the assignment is optional for the group coordinator.**

3. After everyone has posted their information on Thursday, review everything and have an informal discussion: What are **recurrent features, audiences, and purposes** for these fact sheets? What are **typical actions** they are used to accomplish? Finally, what do these tell you or show you that you can apply as you're creating your own fact sheets?
 - **The group discussion part of the assignment is *not* optional for the group coordinator.**

## Looking ahead

[See the Week 09 notes](week-09-notes). Get to researching! Also, we'll explore the joy of progress reports.
