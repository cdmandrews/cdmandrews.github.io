# Overview for Week 14

[ENGL 3301, Fall 2020](../calendar.html)

## Big picture

Writing, researching, designing, more writing. We are SO. CLOSE.

## Tuesday

Submit a progress report for your second project. To simplify file-sharing, please **just add your progress report on to the end of your project 2 proposal**
1. Add a page break at the end of your progress report.
2. Use the same format as the last progress report: 1) Status summary, 2) Timeline or Overview (you can just copy/paste your timeline from the proposal and update it with new information), 3) Issues and questions, 4) Conclusion
4. Remember to provide **specific details** and not vague generalizations.
3. Tag me in a comment to let me know that your progress report is ready.


## Thursday

Keep working on your projects, collaborating with your peers, discussing how things are going with me, and otherwise seeking help early and often.

## Looking ahead

[Next week](week-15-notes) will be a final round of peer review. We have done this before, so it should be fairly smooth sailing. You may begin peer review at any time before next week if you like.
