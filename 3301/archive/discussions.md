# discussion forum prompts for 3301

## Chapter 1 forum

Chapter 1 of The Essentials of Technical Communication (ETC) discusses the characteristics of writing at work and compares expectations for writing in the workplace to writing for school. Consider what we have read apply it to your own experiences.

- Have you written or read something that was for work or your professional field?
- Have you written or read something that was written for academia?
- Upload an example document with your post. How does it exemplify some of the major characteristics discussed in the chapter?

For all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.

Technology Tip: If you have formatting problems, composing in a plaintext editor (such as Notepad++ for PCs or BBEdit for Macs, both of which are free) and then copy/pasting into Blackboard may be a good strategy. Copy/paste from Word often introduces odd formatting. You can also use &quot;CTRL+SHIFT+V&quot; (for PC) or &quot;CMD+SHIFT+V&quot; (for Macs) to paste without formatting.

## Chapter 3 Forum

For your Chapter 3 forum post, describe how five of the seven &quot;ways writers might communicate unethically&quot; (listed above) might be relevant to you when you&#39;re working in your profession. Obviously, plagiarism is an important issue to talk about for school, but for this post I want you to think beyond college and into how these are relevant concerns as a professional. Which seem to be most important in the line of work you&#39;d like to take up? Which ones will you particularly need to avoid or be aware of?

Rather than writing one loooong paragraph, format a list of your five principles and describe each of them in turn. Use text formatting to emphasize important information.

Summarize a recent news story (must be from the last five years) that exemplifies one of the five principles you wrote about. Ideally, these should be about a professional in your field (i.e. a health communicator fudging the numbers, or someone&#39;s vague report-writing leading to trouble)

As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed

## Chapter 4 Forum

Hey, wait! Did you review the overview for this week? Go to Course Content --\&gt; Weekly Activities --\&gt; Week 04 and review the full schedule overview there!

Participate in the Chapter 4 Forum according to the prompt below:

Search for an example of text from a document in the career field, job, or field you will be investigating for this class. Copy and paste a section (no more than a paragraph) into the forum text box. Analyze the text according to principles in chapter 4, discussing at least 3 specific principles. Based on what you read, is this work written in a readable style? Why or why not? How do you know?

- Remember to use quoted material from the chapter to support your answer.
- Identify the career, major, discipline, or job that the illustration comes from by adding a URL and document title or name to your post.
- As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.

## Chapter 5 Forum

As detailed in chapter 5, good document design helps your intended audience locate the information they need quickly and effectively. As you may realize from reading the chapter, designing uncluttered pages that are easy to read is not as simple as it might sound. Because of all of the bells and whistles in our word processors, it&#39;s very easy to create documents that might be ineffective.

For this post, evaluate the City of Corpus Christi 2017 Hurricane Readiness handout

. Suggest specific revisions for improving any problem areas you discover. Use at least 5 of the following points in your discussion, all of which are described in detail in the chapter.|

- How has the designer used blank space to frame/group information?
- Is type of a legible size, color, and design?
- Is text spaced adequately for reading?
- Are line length and margin style effective?
- Are words and illustrations complementary?
- Does the designer use frequent, descriptive, and distinctive headings?

In your post, create descriptive, distinctive headings to help readers scan and locate information.

Later this week, respond to at least three other people in your group.

As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.

## Chapter 6 Forum

Participate in the Chapter 6 Forum according to the prompt below:

o Analyze and discuss different types of illustrations in this EPA document, Tackling Bed Bugs: A Starter Guide for Local Government. Using principles in Chapter 6, evaluate the effectiveness of the guide&#39;s visuals:

-  What is the document&#39;s purpose and audience?
-  How effective are illustrations in the document? That is, are tables and figures well-suited to the document&#39;s purpose and audience?
-  What do you notice about the creator&#39;s methods of numbering, labeling, and citation? Which guidelines in the textbook do they follow?
-  Are illustrations genuinely informative or are they decorative?

o As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.

o Be sure to reply and respond to your group member&#39;s posts over the course of the week. Do you concur with their evaluation?

## Chapter 7 Forum

Chapter 7 describes correspondence genres: emails, letters, and memos. In the discussion forum text box, provide a recent example of an email you sent to either an instructor or a boss.This should not be a personal email to friends or family, but someone who should be receiving a professional email. Look in your Sent folder in your Islander email or personal email account for examples.Redact email addresses where necessary. Don&#39;t accidentally share confidential information!

Put a big line after your email.

Below that line, analyze your email according to the principles found in Chapter 7. Support your analysis using specific information from ETC chapter 7, using quotations and page numbers from the text. Apply at least five separate principles you read about in the chapter.

• For example: According to Tebeaux and Dragga, writers should &quot;avoid sending bad news by text or email&quot; (p. 142). In the case of my email, I forgot to make sure to...

Respond to at least three other people in your group. Read their email and analysis, and in your response, describe how two other principles might apply to their email. Select principles they haven&#39;t written about already.

• As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.

## Group intro and all-purpose forum

Post to this introductory discussion forum before 5:00pm on Tuesday. Write an introductory post in which you cover each of the following topics:

- Introduce yourself, your major, and your #goals
- Describe any professional or job-related writing experience you have. Did you have to use a company account for that internship? Did you ever take meeting minutes for a club you&#39;re in? Manage a Facebook account for a nonprofit? Do you have a work email account? Write a personal statement to get a promotion?
- Choose a fictional character that represents who you are. At the end of your introduction, post a gif of the character and explain why you chose this character.

Respond to your peers&#39; introductory statements. Say hello. Get to know each other. These are your fellow learners for the next 15 weeks.

Beyond the intro thread for the first week, this forum will be a good all-purpose discussion forum. We&#39;ll use it to decide on group names, for instance, but you might also use it for other in-group discussions that might need to happen that don&#39;t have an otherwise dedicated forum. This is YOUR space, please use it to communicate with each other!

## Recommendation Report Q&amp;A for Group A

This Q&amp;A Forum contains discussion threads for the second major project, the Recommendation Report.

## Reference Sheet Q&amp;A for Group A

This Q&amp;A Forum contains discussion threads for the first major project, the Reference Sheet on writing in your field.

## Researching forum

Participate in this Researching Forum according to the prompt below:

- Summarize what you have learned about power searching. (No shorter than 150 words)
- Then reflect on how you feel this course will help you in research projects you&#39;ll complete later in the course.How did you think your search skills were before taking the power searching course, and how do they match up now?
- Post the screenshot of your mid-course assessment.

Responses to peers&#39; posts are not required for this post.

As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.

## Week 12 Forum: Another Look at Reports

Reports are... diverse! Chapter 8 in your textbook introduces some more-or-less universal report writing concepts, but each report is unique and must be written as a unique response to its context. Reports respond to specific readers, purposes, and contexts, rather than simple generic rules. There are many sub-genres or kinds of reports, such as:

- recommendation reports
- evaluation reports
- technical background reports
- feasability reports
- annual reports
- progress/status reports
- trip reports
- personnel reports
- economic justification reports
- pretty much all kinds of reports.

Reports may blend a variety of purposes: informing, analyzing, recommending, persuading, justifying, CYA, and many, many other purposes.

Along with Chapter 8 in your textbook, read &quot;Types of technical reports: An overview&quot;. Both of these resources will help you think about structure, audience, purpose, and content for your own report.

This Google Drive folder includes a variety of professional and technical reports. Skim through the folder, select any two reports, and respond to the following in your post to this forum.

- Which reports did you review?
- Who is supposed to read this report? Locate information about the report&#39;s audience(s). Where did you find it? What form did that information take? (Your answer must not be &quot;the public,&quot; &quot;the general public,&quot;or &quot;anyone who reads it.&quot; )
- Why would someone use this report, and what would they use it for? Locate information about the report&#39;s purpose(s). What is the intended purpose? Where did you find it? What form did that information take?
- As you through the reports you selected, what features did you notice that made the reports especially readable, skimmable, or usable by their intended audience? What were some of the interesting features that you&#39;d spotlight in a report you looked at?

## Week 13: Project 2 thoughts

For this Tuesday&#39;s assignment, use the Week 13 discussion forum and discuss your progress in thinking about and planning your recommendation report. Some topics to write about:

1. What document are you analyzing and recommending revisions to?

- What is the document&#39;s audience? (That is, who is the document written for? What information do they need to know? What will they do with that information?)
- What is the document&#39;s purpose?
- What is the document&#39;s occasion or context? Why was it written? Why would someone need to read this document?

2. List the 5 criteria for &quot;good professional writing&quot; you&#39;re considering for your evaluation--for now, state them as a complete sentence (Like: &quot;Technical manuals must have many illlustrations&quot; or &quot;Patient discharge summaries should avoid technical jargon&quot;, etc.)

o To develop criteria/characteristics, remember the major elements of technical communication we&#39;ve covered this semester. We&#39;ve been evaluating documents and talking about situations that have to do with these and other major topics. Many of these chapters have characteristics and evaluative criteria you can use in this report, or you can create your own based on your research.

- Writing at work vs writing at school (Chapter 1)
- Writing for your readers/users (Chapter 2)
- Writing ethically (Chapter 3)
- Achieving a readable style (Chapter 4)
- Designing documents (Chapter 5)
- Designing illustrations (Chapter 6)
- Writing genres (memos and correspondence, reports, proposals, etc) (Chapters 7 on)
- What texts or research will you cite to help develop your definitions of these criteria?

3. What other ideas, problems, or questions do you have about the report thus far?

Write inventively and reflectively, and comment thoughtfully on your peers&#39; posts. What ideas seem most interesting or compelling? What questions do you have for them about their topic? What support can you give?

## Week 13: Tentative analysis

This week, you&#39;ll share the beginnings of your analysis and evaluation.

Download the attached &quot;project2-20s-scaffolding.docx&quot; document and save it to your computer

Add the requested information, save it, and upload the new version to this &quot;Week 13: Tentative Analysis&quot; forum. For the forum post, write 2-3 lingering questions you have about your characteristics, evaluation, and recommendations.

Respond and reply to your peers; answering questions and providing feedback on their materials.

## Week 14: Audience Analysis

This week, you&#39;ll spend some time doing audience analaysis. As Tebeaux and Dragga noted:

A host of factors determine your readers&#39; perception: education, family, geographical and cultural background, job responsibilities, rank in the organization, age, life experiences, and gender--just to name a few demographics that define how people see the world. How much your readers know about your topic determines what you say and the technical level of your presentation.

First, read the following:

- ETC Chapter 2: Writing for your readers
- Audience Analysis: Just who are these guys?

Then write about your specific audience for your recommendation report. Answer the following questions

- Who is the primary reader for my recommendation report? (Remember--you don&#39;t have to actually send this report to them, but you do need to write as if you were.)
- What is the primary reader going to DO with my report?
- What is the organization my primary reader works for? What&#39;s their position and title? What is their profession and field?
- How much do they know or not know about my topic? (Remember, your topic is both &quot;good technical writing&quot; and the document itself.) Do they have expertise in this area?
- Do you know or can you estimate your readers&#39; educational levels?
- Will your readers have an interest in what you write?
- Why do your readers need what you write?
- What kind of relationship do you have with these readers?
- What is the reader&#39;s attitude toward you and the subject matter you need to communicate?
- Do you have credibility with these readers?
- How well do you know your readers?

As you respond to these questions, think about what you&#39;ll need to do to make your message appealing, clear, and persuasive to your readers. Summarize some of your ideas and strategizing here to discuss and clarify with your group.

## Week 15 TPW Debrief Forum

Reflection is an important component of learning. This week&#39;s discussion is a final and intentional opportunity for you to reflect and debrief on the course together with the members of your group. (You should also complete your course evals, by the way.) It&#39;s a chance to connect the dots between what we&#39;ve done, what we&#39;ve said, and what we&#39;ve read. It&#39;s also a good chance to have some closure with the 8-12 people you&#39;ve been hearing from and sharing with for the semester.

So, even though we&#39;re not quiiiite done yet, how&#39;d it go? (Obviosuly, the Coronavirus has been fairly definitive for the semester.)

Share with your group what you learned in this class, what you struggled with, and what you succeeded at. How will you apply lessons learned from this course in the future--whether that be future coursework, careers and the job market, or community work?

Finally, post a meme or animated gif that to you adequately represents this semester.

For full credit on this reflection, you must also engage in conversation with your group--reply, respond, discuss, say farewell, and generally bring things down to a close.

## Week 6 Forum: What is TC?

- View &quot;What is Technical Communication&quot; from Carol Siri Johnson
- Read &quot;Defining Technical Communication&quot; from the Society of Technical Communication (STC) homepage
- Read &quot;Professional and Technical Communication: An Overview&quot; from Writing Commons

Participate in the Week 6 Forum according to the following prompt:

• So, what exactly is technical communication? What definitions of technical communication can you find in the assigned texts, and how do those definitions complicate or extend what we&#39;ve studied already? Finally, how do the ideas and concepts in Professional and Technical Communication connect to the sort of writing you&#39;ll be doing in your own professional field someday, whether that&#39;s in the criminal justice system, freelance writing, environmental science, or physical therapy? Along with your textbook and the texts I&#39;ve listed above, find one other source (in the library, in a scholarly journal, or another formal source) that provides a definition or explanation of technical communication/technical and professional writing.

• Your post should be at least 300 words long and make specific references to the assigned texts (including quotations and some form of in-text citation).

• As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.

• Be sure to reply and respond to your group member&#39;s posts over the course of the week. How did you understand these different definitions?

## Week 8 Forum: Progress Report

Participate in your group&#39;s &quot;Week 8: Status Report&quot; forum no later than Thursday at 5:00 pm according to the following prompt:

By this point, you have begun working on your Reference Sheet, the Analysis of Writing in your Field project. Write an informal progress report on the status of your project and post it to the Week 08 group forum. You should describe:

- your project goals,
- the work you have accomplished,
- the work you have remaining, and
- problems you have encountered.

Your textbook describes progress reports on pages 255ff. Use subheadings to structure your progress report. Write paragraphs in each section, not just simple single sentences--take this seriously as an update on what you&#39;ve done, what you&#39;ve got planned, and how you&#39;re going to get it done. It is also a chance to practice this traditional PTW genre.

Do not prepare and upload a separate document. Post the text of your progress report directly into the discussion forum text box and use Blackboard&#39;s formatting tools to add design features.

Return to this forum on Thursday evening and Friday. Review your group members&#39; responses and answer questions, share resources, and otherwise be collaborative.
