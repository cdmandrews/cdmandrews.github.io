#Weekly schedule/overviews for 3301 (Spring 2020, with COVID-19 mods)

# Week 01

No assignments or course documents, including the syllabus, should be considered to be in their final form until the first week of class begins.

Each week, I&#39;ll provide you a Weekly overview. The information here will detail specific readings, exercises, and due dates for each week.

If you find something in error, or are confused about any part of the instructions, please post them to the Troubleshooting forum on Blackboard or email me at [christopher.andrews@tamucc.edu](mailto:christopher.andrews@tamucc.edu). If your question is one that the entire class will benefit from hearing, I will likely repost it in the Troubleshooting forum!

We have a lot to do for the first week:

- Clarify the nature of and goals for the course
- Get situated for online learning
- Get to know each other a bit
- Get started thinking about the distinctions between writing for work and writing for school.

## Due Tuesday, January 21 before midnight

1. Locate and carefully read our class syllabus on Blackboard. Also, overview our Blackboard course shell. Can you locate:
  1. Weekly assignments?
  2. Weekly quizzes?
  3. Major projects?
  4. Troubleshooting forum?
  5. Your group area?
  6. Policies for late work, revision, and other issues that commonly come up in a semester?
2. Complete the &quot;First week of class survey&quot;
3. Upload a (good) profile picture to Blackboard. If you need instructions, visit [Creating your Blackboard Profile](https://en-us.help.blackboard.com/Learn/9.1_Older_Versions/9.1_2014_and_2015/Student/030_Nav_My_Blackboard/Profiles).
4. Post to your group&#39;s introductory discussion forum  **before midnight on Tuesday**. Write an introductory post in which you cover each of the following topics:
  1. Introduce yourself, your major, and your #goals
  2. Describe any professional or job-related writing experience you have. Did you have to use a company email account for that internship? Did you ever take meeting minutes for a club you&#39;re in? Did you help manage an Instagram account for a nonprofit? Do you have a work email account? Have you ever had to write a personal statement to get a promotion?
  3. Choose a fictional character that represents who you are. At the end of your introduction, [post a gif of the character ](https://youtu.be/jp9HA6en5BA)and explain why you chose this character.
  4. Respond to your peers&#39; introductory statements. Say hello. Get to know each other. These are your fellow learners for the next 15 weeks.

## Due Thursday, January 23 by 5:00 pm

1. Read Chapters 1 &amp; 2 of _The Essentials of Technical Communication_ (ETC). A PDF is attached below if your textbook has not come in yet; I also placed copies on hold at the library.
2. Write the first entry in your Workplace writing journal. Scroll further down in this folder for the prompt and a link to your journal.
3. Complete Chapter 1 &amp; 2 quizzes, due no later than 5:00 pm on  **Friday**.
4. Participate in your group&#39;s Chapter 1 Forum according to the following prompt:
  1. Chapter 1 discusses the characteristics of writing at work and compares expectations for writing in the workplace to writing for school. Consider what we have read and apply it to your own experiences.
  2. Have you written or read something that was for work or your professional field?
  3. Have you written or read something that was written for academia?
  4. Upload an example document with your post. How does it exemplify some of the major characteristics discussed in the chapter?
  5. **For all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.**
  6. **Technology Tip** : If you have formatting problems, composing in a plaintext editor (such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for PCs or [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) for Macs, both of which are free) and then copy/pasting into Blackboard may be a good strategy. Copy/paste from Word often introduces odd formatting. You can also use &quot;CTRL+SHIFT+V&quot; (for PC) or &quot;CMD+SHIFT+V&quot; (for Macs) to paste without formatting.

## Next Week:

We&#39;ll keep going with Chapters 3 and 7 in The Essentials of Technical Communication. We will skip around in the textbook, so be sure to read the right chapters!.

 View next week&#39;s schedule now to see specific exercise and discussion assignments and due dates. Early work is permitted, but all late work will receive a 10% penalty. &quot;My computer is messed up&quot; and &quot;I didn&#39;t see the schedule&quot; are NOT acceptable excuses in an online course. Look ahead, and have a plan B for when your computer crashes. (Because it just might.)

# Week 02

This week, you need to finalize your group&#39;s name. Look for the flagged thread in your group&#39;s introductions forum and deliberate there. I will change your group names after you&#39;ve all agreed on one.

## Due Tuesday, January 28

1. Read Chapter 7 of _The Essentials of Technical Communication_ (ETC). Take the Chapter 7 quiz, which is due by 5:00 pm on Friday.
2. Dig around a bit and look for example memos or letters in one of the following sources/archives. Can you find examples of principles from Chapter 7 in action?
  1. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), [list of Hazard Alerts and letters to employers](https://www.osha.gov/ooc/alerts-letters.html)
  2. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) [memos archive](https://www.uscis.gov/archive/archive-laws/archive-memos)
3. Participate in the Chapter 7 Forum according to the prompt below:
  1. Chapter 7 describes correspondence genres: emails, letters, and memos. In the discussion forum text box, provide a recent example of an email you sent to either an instructor or a boss.This should not be a personal email to friends or family, but someone who _should_ be receiving a professional email. Look in your Sent folder in your Islander email or personal email account for examples. **Redact email addresses where necessary. Don&#39;t accidentally share confidential information!**
  2. Post the text of the email directly into the forum text box; do not upload a separate document..
  3. Put a big line after your email.
  4. Below that line, analyze your email according to the principles found in Chapter 7. Support your analysis using specific information from ETC chapter 7, using quotations and page numbers from the text. Apply  **at least five**  separate principles you read about in the chapter.
    1. For example:  According to Tebeaux and Dragga, writers should &quot;avoid sending bad news by text or email&quot; (p. 142). In the case of my email, I forgot to make sure to...
  5. Respond to at least three other people in your group. Read their email and analysis, and in your response, describe how two other principles might apply to their email. Select principles they haven&#39;t written about already.
  6. **As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.**

## Due Thursday, January 30

Chapter Three is about professional ethics and communication ethics. Writers and professionals should consider to whom they have ethical obligations, the major types of unethical communication (whether intentional or unintentional), and central issues for using copyrighted information in professional organizations.

Just following rules of thumb for good writing is not enough. Professionals must think about what they say and how the audience will be affected by it. Corner cutting or intentionally vague wording can have a big impact in our world of knee-jerk lawsuits and fierce competition. Sadly, we can read about people communicating unethically just about every day--and the implications of their failure to be ethical.

1. Read Chapter 3 of _The Essentials of Technical Communication_ (ETC). Take the Chapter 3 quiz by Friday.
2. Participate in the Chapter 3 Forum according to the prompt below:
  1. For your Chapter 3 forum post, describe how  **five**  of the seven &quot;ways writers might communicate unethically&quot; (listed above) might be relevant to you when you&#39;re working in your profession. Obviously, plagiarism is an important issue to talk about for school, but for this post I want you to think beyond college and into how these are relevant concerns as a professional. Which seem to be most important in the line of work you&#39;d like to take up? Which ones will you particularly need to avoid or be aware of?
  2. Rather than writing one loooong paragraph, format a list of your five principles and describe each of them in turn. Use text formatting to  **emphasize**  important information.
  3. **BONUS** : For extra points, share a link to a recent news story (must be from the last five years) that exemplifies one of the five principles you wrote about. Ideally, these should be about a professional in your field (i.e. a health communicator fudging the numbers, or someone&#39;s vague report-writing leading to trouble)
  4. **As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.**
3. Post an entry in your workplace writing journal. You have two options this week--one is if you&#39;ve found a person you can interview, and one is if you haven&#39;t.  For either option, your journal entry should be no shorter than 250 words.
  1. **Option A** : Go back to your list of professionals to talk to in your workplace writing journal. Choose one, and ask them to describe their most important dos and don&#39;ts for work-related email or text messaging. Post the information you get from them as a new entry in your workplace writing journal, and reflect on what you learned from them and how that aligns or not with your own e-mail experiences.
  2. **Option B:**  Search the internet for at least three advice or how-to articles on workplace or professional email. (Here&#39;s a starter for you, from the [_Heroic Technical Writing_](https://heroictechwriting.com/2011/12/20/using-the-tools-effectively%E2%80%8F/) blog). Provide links to each article, and briefly summarize the content. What are some of the most important principles for work email you read about? These don&#39;t have to just be style tips, but also workplace culture tips like how frequently to check email, when to do email, etcetera.

## Next Week:

We&#39;ll keep going with Chapters 5 and 8 in The Essentials of Technical Communication. We will skip around in the textbook, so be sure to read the right chapters!.

 View next week&#39;s schedule now to see specific exercise and discussion assignments and due dates. Early work is permitted, but all late work will receive a 10% penalty. &quot;My computer is messed up&quot; and &quot;I didn&#39;t see the schedule&quot; are NOT acceptable excuses in an online course. Look ahead, and have a plan B for when your computer crashes. (Because it just might.)

# Week 03

## Due Tuesday, February 4 by 5:00 pm

1. Read Chapter 5 of _The Essentials of Technical Communication_ (ETC). Take the Chapter 5 quiz, which is due by 5:00 pm on Friday.
2. Review these short articles describing how headings and subheadings can make a big difference in your documents:
  1. [Subheadings: Perhaps the most useful technique in technical writing](https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/08/23/subheadings-perhaps-the-most-useful-technique-in-technical-writing/)
  2. [Headings: Make your text scannable](https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/headings.html)
3.  Participate in the Chapter 5 Forum according to the prompt below:
  1. As detailed in chapter 5, good document design helps your intended audience locate the information they need quickly and effectively. As you may realize from reading the chapter, designing uncluttered pages that are easy to read is not as simple as it might sound. Because of all of the bells and whistles in our word processors, it&#39;s very easy to create documents that might be ineffective.

 For this post, evaluate the  [City of Corpus Christi 2017 Hurricane Readiness handout](https://bb9.tamucc.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-3409089-dt-content-rid-35088686_1/xid-35088686_1).  **Suggest specific revisions for**  improving any problem areas you discover. Use at least 5 of the following points in your discussion, all of which are described in detail in the chapter
    1. How has the designer used blank space to frame/group information?
    2. Is type of a legible size, color, and design?
    3. Is text spaced adequately for reading?
    4. Are line length and margin style effective?
    5. Are words and illustrations complementary?
    6. Does the designer use frequent, descriptive, and distinctive headings?
  2. In your own post, use descriptive, distinctive headings to help readers scan and locate information.
  3. Later this week, respond to at least three other people in your group.
  4. **As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.**

## Due Thursday,February 6 by 5:00 pm

1. This week we&#39;ll take a little break from ETC and work on your researching skills.
2. To do so, I&#39;m assigning a short &quot;[Power Searching with Google](https://coursebuilder.withgoogle.com/sample/course)&quot; course. For this Thursday, complete the following:
  1. Pre-course assessment
  2. Units 1, 2, and 3. (We will complete the course next week if you would like to work ahead).
  3. Complete all unit activities except for the embedded discussion forum posts.
  4. Mid-course assessment
  5. Take a screenshot of your mid-course assessment when you have successfully completed it.
3. Participate in the Researching Forum according to the prompt below:
  1. Summarize what you have learned about power searching. (No shorter than 150 words) Then reflect on how you feel this course will help you in research projects you&#39;ll complete later in the course. How did you think your search skills were before taking the power searching course, and how do they match up now?
  2. Post the screenshot of your mid-course assessment.
  3. Responses to peers&#39; posts are not required for this post.
  4. **As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.**
4. Post an entry in your workplace writing journal. You again have two options this week--one is if you&#39;ve found a person you can interview, and one is if you haven&#39;t.  For either option, your journal entry should be no shorter than 250 words
  1. **Option A** : Go back to your list of professionals to talk to in your workplace writing journal. When they need information specifically related to the writing and reporting they do as part of their job, where do they search? Do they use specialized databases or reference sources, or do they navigate the internet for information? Do they interview other experts, or use other sources of information? Report on your findings in your journal.
  2. **Option B:**  Find information about at least thee professional associations or organizations someone in your profession might be a member of. These might be international, national, regional, state, or local organizations. (For example. a  **technical writer**  might be a member of the Society for Technical Communication.) Provide links to each professional association&#39;s website, and  summarize the content that&#39;s provided there. What resources do these wbesites provide? What kinds of reports, fact sheets, or other documents do they publish? Is there a social media presence? Report on your findings in your journal.

## Next Week:

We&#39;ll keep going with Chapters 4 and 8  in The Essentials of Technical Communication. We will skip around in the textbook, so be sure to read the right chapters!.

 View next week&#39;s schedule now to see specific exercise and discussion assignments and due dates. Early work is permitted, but all late work will receive a 10% penalty. &quot;My computer is messed up&quot; and &quot;I didn&#39;t see the schedule&quot; are NOT acceptable excuses in an online course. Look ahead, and have a plan B for when your computer crashes. (Because it just might.)

# Week 04

## Due Tuesday, February 18 by 5:00 pm

Humans are incredibly visual creatures. Look at any Instagram account and you will see evidence that we are able to communicate rich, specific information in an incredibly short time with a picture. (Insert that cliché we all know about a thousand words here.)

As Tebeaux and Dragga note in the chapter, professional communicators often rely on  **illustrations**  along with or instead of words to convey our messages. ETC breaks illustrations into two categories:  **tables**  and  **figures**. Depending on your academic background, you may or may not have a lot of experience working with tables and figures, but as professional writers, alternate methods of presenting data and information are valuable. You must be able to decide when to use an illustration and evaluate whether or not your illustration will be effective.

Some of you in an earlier assignment pointed out that the &quot;Know&quot; photograph in the Ready Corpus Christi hurricane preparedness flier was a problem: it was a good quality photo, and while it was thematically relevant, it didn&#39;t fit the brief, informative purpose of the document. The photo also took up too much space on the page; the space might have been better suited to more complete information about emergency routes or the ReverseAlert system.

This week, you&#39;ll continue working and thinking about illustrations. In fact, your first major project, the reference sheet on writing in your field will rely just as much on visual design and spatial arrangement as it will on clean written content.

1. Read Chapter 6 of _The Essentials of Technical Communication_ (ETC). Take the Chapter 6 quiz, which is due by 5:00 pm on Friday.
2. Participate in the Chapter 6 Forum according to the prompt below:
  1. Analyze and discuss different types of illustrations in this EPA document, [Tackling Bed Bugs: A Starter Guide for Local Government](http://npic.orst.edu/pest/bedbug/tacklingbbstarterguide.pdf). Using principles in Chapter 6, evaluate the effectiveness of the guide&#39;s visuals:
    1. What is the document&#39;s specific purpose and specific audience? (Hint: It is NOT the &quot;general public&quot; or &quot;people who have bedbugs in their houses.&quot;)
    2. How effective are illustrations in the document? That is, are tables and figures well-suited to the document&#39;s purpose and audience?
    3. What do you notice about the creator&#39;s methods of numbering, labeling, and citation? Which guidelines in the textbook do they follow?
    4. Are illustrations genuinely informative or are they decorative?
  2. **As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.**
  3. **Be sure to reply and respond to your group member&#39;s posts over the course of the week. Do you concur with their evaluation?**

## Due Thursday, February 20 by 5:00 pm

1. Chapter 9 of The Essentials of Technical Communication (ETC). Take the Chapter 9 quiz, which is due by 5:00 pm on Friday. We will come back to proposals and progress reports later in the term, so file this information away for now.
2. Complete the &quot;Document Design Features in Microsoft Word exercise&quot; and upload it to Blackboard. There is no group forum assignment for this exercise.
  1. You probably already know how to do basic formatting of text in MS Word using Font and Paragraph tools. In this exercise, you&#39;ll build on that knowledge and practice using the Quick Styles Pane and other Ribbon tools in Microsoft Word&#39;s interface to adjust the style and formatting of the exercise document.
  2. Like many aspects of Microsoft Word, there are multiple options to change things: keyboard shortcuts, contextual menus, and the ribbon. This exercise includes only a few methods; visit [https://support.office.com/](https://support.office.com/) to see other methods for creating and modifying stylesheets, tables, and figures in your documents.
  3. **Download the Word document attached to the assignment and save it to your computer. The document has four parts; follow the instructions in the document and edit it as you go. When you are finished with Parts 1-4, save the file and upload it to the &quot;Document Design Features in Microsoft Word&quot; assignment in Blackboard.**
  4. **in the &quot;Submission comments&quot; on the Bb assignment, briefly describe successes or struggles you had with this exercise.**
3. Spend some time reviewing the first major project description, which is located in the Course Content folder. Download the text description and review the short video. There is no journal assignment this week.

## Next Week:

We&#39;ll look at Chapter 8 in The Essentials of Technical Communication and do some thinking about technical and professional writing in general.

# Week 06

## Due Tuesday, February 25 by 5:00 pm.

1. Participate in the Week 6 Forum according to the following prompt:
  1. View [&quot;What is Technical Communication&quot;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi5eZ2XLJc4) from Carol Siri Johnson
  2. Read [&quot;Defining Technical Communication&quot;](https://www.stc.org/about-stc/defining-technical-communication/) from the Society of Technical Communication (STC) homepage
  3. Read [&quot;Professional and Technical Communication: An Overview&quot;](http://writingcommons.org/professional-and-technical-communication-an-overview) from Writing Commons
  4. So, what exactly is _technical communication_? What definitions of technical communication can you find in the assigned texts, and how do those definitions complicate or extend what we&#39;ve studied already? Finally, how do the ideas and concepts in Professional and Technical Communication connect to the sort of writing you&#39;ll be doing in your own professional field someday, whether that&#39;s in the criminal justice system, freelance writing, environmental science, or physical therapy? Along with your textbook and the texts I&#39;ve listed above, find one other source (in the library, in a scholarly journal, or another formal source) that provides a definition or explanation of technical communication/technical and professional writing.
  5. Your post should be at least  **300**  words long and make  **specific references**  to the assigned texts (including quotations and some form of in-text citation).
  6. As with all discussion forum assignments, post the text of your responses directly to the forum text box. Do not upload a separate document unless instructed to.
  7. **Be sure to reply and respond to your group member&#39;s posts over the course of the week. How did you understand these different definitions?**

## Due Thursday, February 27 by 5:00 pm

1. Review these two short discussions about genre
  1. &quot;On genre&quot; _SLCC Open English._ [https://openenglishatslcc.pressbooks.com/chapter/on-genre/](https://openenglishatslcc.pressbooks.com/chapter/on-genre/)
  2. &quot;Genre in the wild: Understanding genre within rhetorical (eco)systems. SLCC Open English. [https://openenglishatslcc.pressbooks.com/chapter/genre-in-the-wild-understanding-genre-within-rhetorical-ecosystems/](https://openenglishatslcc.pressbooks.com/chapter/genre-in-the-wild-understanding-genre-within-rhetorical-ecosystems/)
  3. Genre is a good concept to use to talk about texts because it reminds us that texts are conventional in that there are often more or less &quot;rules&quot; to follow when creating them, but it also reminds us that those conventions are not stable-for-all-times-and-places.
2. Participate in your group&#39;s &quot;Reference Sheet Q&amp;A&quot; forum thread according to the following prompt:
  1. The first of two major course projects is the Reference Sheet on Writing in your Field. For today&#39;s post, you will locate relevant information about this project, assess the task, and make a plan for completing it.
  2. Before you write your response to this post, you should review the project description for Project 1, the Reference sheet on writing in your field. Download the text description and review the short video; these outline goals, processes, and requirements for the project. Check out the example posted in the Project 1 folder.
  3. Post a reply to the &quot;Reference Sheet Q&amp;A&quot; thread about your understanding of the first major project. Write about your understanding of the assignment, your understanding of the concept of genre, how you&#39;re going to approach the project, and any questions you have about it. In your post, link to or mention two resources OTHER THAN a search engine where you might locate documents for your analysis.
  4. Return to this thread on Thursday evening and Friday. Review your group members&#39; responses and then go back to edit your original post. See if what others have written helps you answer your question. Try to answer questions posted by your fellow students!
3. Complete the &quot;PTW Midterm&quot; quiz, linked in this week&#39;s folder. Not actually a mid-term in terms of its grade weight, this quiz is intended to help you apply what you&#39;ve learned and reflect on what professional and technical writing really is or can be. See the quiz itself for complete instructions. There are 3 short paragraph questions and 12 yes/no questions. Unlike our normal reading quizzes, there are no repeat takes and no backtracking. You must answer the questions in the order they appear, but you may save your progress and take as long as you need to complete the quiz.

## Next Week:

We&#39;re digging right on in to the first major project. Get started researching! You&#39;ll dig into your professional writing journals and begin locating examples of genres in action.

# Week 07

## Due Tuesday, March 3 by 5:00 pm.

Nothing. Breathe. Reflect. Catch up on something. There&#39;s nothing due for Tuesday.

## Due Thursday, March 5 by 5:00 pm

This week you&#39;re Locating information about and examples of important written genres that professionals create in your field using interview, web research, and library research. Apply what you know about advanced search strategies. But also remember that Google doesn&#39;t index every page of every site on the internet, and that not every PDF or HTML document on every website will show up on a web search.

Because I&#39;m a student of professional and technical communication, I know that  **institutions**  generate, sponsor, and have authorship of tons of professional and technical writing, I can do some detective work and search institutions&#39; web content.

For example--let&#39;s say I&#39;m a pre-law student. I might start my Google search looking for a list of major law firms in Texas, or a specific one if I know of it. I might search for a list of legal bloggers (professional social media is professional writing, too!), or search for professional organizations (is there an association for police chiefs? environmental scientists? safety inspectors?).

I also know I can look at federal, state, and municipal websites (most often ending with a .gov). State courts have a website, counties have websites, cities have websites, as do professional organizations.

When I&#39;m scanning organizations&#39; web pages, I look in navigation menus and page footers for key terms like publications, transparency, or reports and follow those links. I use website-specific searches rather than only full internet searches. I vary between specific names for genres (amicus briefs) and general ones (briefs, proposals, reports). If the site has a publically-searchable database, I might try to poke around in that, if the system will let me

1. Continue researching for the Reference Sheet on Writing in your Field.
2. **Return to your group&#39;s &quot;Reference Sheet Q&amp;A&quot; forum thread no later than Thursday, March 5 at 5:00 pm and participate according to the following prompt:**
  1. Write about what you&#39;ve found thus far. What kinds of texts have you found? What kinds are you aware of? What good sources or locations for information do you have? What research problems are you struggling with?
  2. Return to this thread on Thursday evening and Friday. Review your group members&#39; responses and answer questions, share resources, and otherwise be collaborative.

## Next Week:

We&#39;ll begin drafting your Reference Sheet and work on the formatting issues that are most likely to crop up in the process.

# Week 08

## Due Tuesday, March 17 by 5:00 pm.

1. **Continue researching for your Reference Sheet on Writing in your Field**. Locate information about and examples of important written genres that professionals create in your field using interview, web research, and library research. A &quot;stuckpoint&quot; for many of us will be thinking in specific ways about genres and subgenres. Don&#39;t get stuck on &quot;email&quot; or &quot;reports&quot;--dig deeper. What different purposes or different &quot;kinds&quot; of emails get used? What different types and subtypes of reports are used? Look at the examples posted in the Project 1 folder to see how they handle genres and sub-genres.
2. **For Tuesday, r**** [eview this handout on using tables and adjusting page layouts](https://bb9.tamucc.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-3409094-dt-content-rid-34890696_1/xid-34890696_1) **** **
  1. As the assignment description notes, your reference must be on a  **single**  page. You&#39;re not making a document that will live as an 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheet of paper (and I won&#39;t print them out!). Instead think of this as a poster: That means you can ignore normal printer rules for margins, and you will have to use much smaller font sizes than you&#39;re used to as you&#39;re creating your design.
  2. If you haven&#39;t already, set up your reference sheet table in a Microsoft Word document. You should:
    1. Create a table and refresh yourself on the various Table Design and Table Layout tools.
    2. Adjust page layout and margins to maximize page space.
    3. Even if you are planning to create an infographic using Canva or some other tool, go ahead and review this handout.
3.   **On Tuesday before 5:00 pm, upload a document to the &quot;Reference Sheet layout&quot; assignment**. This assignment is mostly so we can run up against any bugs earlier rather than later.
  1. Depending on how you&#39;re going to create your reference sheet,  **turn in either a Word document or an infographic template.**
  2. **If you are going to use Word** , your document must include:
    1. A full-page table. Your table may be blank, or you may begin filling the table with your research findings
    2. Customized page size with margins minimized to 0&quot;. Use any page size you like other than 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;
    3. Your reference sheet may include the beginnings of a design, or it may be a blank, black-and-white table.
    4. For full functionality, use Word installed on your computer, and not Word Online. (Reminder: as a TAMU-CC student you have access to free downloads of Microsoft Office for your personal use. Visit [TAMUCC IT for a download link](http://it.tamucc.edu/Desktops%20and%20Software/University%20Provided%20Software.html).
  3. **If you are going to create an infographic** , your document must include:
    1. A downloaded PDF file (sometimes PNGs or BMPs cause trouble in Blackboard) with the template you think you might use. This may be mostly blank, or you may begin filling your reference sheet with your research findings
    2. Do not use the &quot;share document&quot; link to publish your file to Blackboard.

## Due Thursday, March 19 by 5:00 pm

1. Continue researching for the Reference Sheet on Writing in your Field. Locate information about and examples of important written genres that professionals create in your field using interview, web research, and library research.
2. **Participate in your group&#39;s &quot;Week 8: Status Report&quot; forum no later than Thursday at 5:00 pm according to the following prompt:**
  1. By this point, you have begun working on your Reference Sheet, the Analysis of Writing in your Field project. Write an informal progress report on the status of your project and post it to the Week 08 group forum. You should describe:
    1. your project goals,
    2. the work you have accomplished,
    3. the work you have remaining, and
    4. problems you have encountered.
  2. Your textbook describes progress reports on pages 255ff. Use  **subheadings**  to structure your progress report. Write  **paragraphs**  in each section, not just simple single sentences--take this  **seriously**  as an update on what you&#39;ve done, what you&#39;ve got planned, and how you&#39;re going to get it done.
  3. Do not prepare and upload a separate document. Post the text of your progress report directly into the discussion forum text box.
  4. Return to this forum on Thursday evening and Friday. Review your group members&#39; responses and answer questions, share resources, and otherwise be collaborative.

## Next Week:

We&#39;ll go back to our chapters on Document Design and Writing Style, applying key lessons about active voice and parallelism to your Reference Sheet as you&#39;re finalizing your drafts to turn in!

# Week 09

This week is all about peer review of your drafts, moving to a completed document. Your Reference Sheet is due on  **Tuesday, April 7**.

I&#39;ve prepared a video for you that should help as you&#39;re editing and finishing up with your reference sheets this week and next. One of your classmates, Jacob Aston graciously volunteered to let me screencast some feedback on his draft.

 The video&#39;s a little long (about 20 minutes--I only edited it very gently), but I go through his reference sheet in detail. It&#39;s definitely worth the time spent. Hopefully this evaluation session will give you some ideas and things to think about as you&#39;re finishing up your own project.

## For Thursday, March 26

A common problem area in professional writing is faulty parallel structure. Review the following material about grammatical parallelism and style in technical and professional writing:

- Revisit ETC Chapter 4
- [Read Parallel Structure](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/parallel_structure.html) from Purdue OWL
- [Read Effective Rhetoric, Effective Writing: Parallelism in Technical Communication](https://helenfawcett.com/technical-writing/effective-rhetoric-effective-writing-parallelism-in-technical-communication/) by Helen Fawcett

As you are revising your reference chart, review it for sections or columns that include parallel grammatical structures. If you don&#39;t have a section or column that uses parallel grammatical structure, consider how you might revise to make the content in a particular column more parallel.

There is no written assignment due for this reading. Please email your instructor if you have questions about this content.

# Week 10

Review the [Rubric for Evaluating Professional and Technical Communication](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11NsIEMqStOEoys2osBQIBwj0B1SKCYbk2IHsI-_QKho/edit?usp=sharing). This document includes the rubric I will use to evaluate the final version of your projects. If you have questions about this rubric, please email me.

**Complete a draft of the Reference Sheet and post it to your Group&#39;s Major Projects Drafting Journal before 5:00 pm on Tuesday, March 31.**

- Your draft should include  **all**  required columns, should include at least  **five**  genres, and should display attempts at meaningful document design choices.
- I am not expecting your draft to be perfect; you&#39;ll receive peer and instructor feedback to help you finish up!
- Along with uploading your draft file, indicate where / what kind of help you would like to have in your journal entry.

**Between Tuesday and Friday, review your group members&#39; draft** s.

- [Peer Review: Commenting Strategies](https://youtu.be/GlSCMx9-fGA) (Video)
- In the Journals area of Blackboard, click the dropdown menu below &quot;Journal Details&quot; to show the list of other students&#39; journals (See screenshot). Locate your group members&#39; journals and review their drafts, providing feedback on the following:
  - **Review their content**. What are they doing well? Have they included all required columns? Other than completing their list of ten genres, what content seems to be missing? What could they do to improve their written content?
  - **Review their design**. Do headings distinguish different kinds of content? Do they use contrast, alignment, proximity, size, and repetition to emphasize relationships in their chart (see ETC chapter 5, page 78)? What could they do to improve their design?

## Turning in the project

The final draft of your project is due on Tuesday, April 7. I will be happy to review drafts with you beforehand, but would prefer to do so in a conference, either in person or via WebEx. Please schedule an appointment to meet with me during the week.

To turn in your completed reference sheet, upload your document to Blackboard (Course Content \&gt; Project 1) on Tuesday, April 7.

# Week 11

This week you&#39;re turning in the first project and getting geared up for the second.

Your Reference Sheet is due on  **Tuesday April 7**. If you have not reviewed feedback from your peers, check your  **Group**   **Journal**  and do so!

I will use this [Rubric for Evaluating Professional and Technical Communication](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11NsIEMqStOEoys2osBQIBwj0B1SKCYbk2IHsI-_QKho/edit?usp=sharing). to evaluate your projects.

Please review the Revise and Resubmit policy described in the Syllabus section of Blackboard. I do permit and encourage revisions if you think you&#39;d like to take another attempt at the project.

After you turn in your project, that&#39;s it for the week. Things you can do to look ahead for next week:

- Review the Project 2 description
- Read Chapter 8 of _The Essentials of Technical Communication,_ which describes elements of formal and informal reports. The chapter 8 quiz will be due  **next**  Friday,
- There&#39;s no post or exercise due this Tuesday or Thursday while I evaluate your projects; we will come back to Chapter 8 again next week.

## Next Week

Participate in this &quot;Recommendation Report Q&amp;A&quot; forum thread

# Week 12

## Due Tuesday, April 14 by 5:00 pm

1. Your second major project will be a Recommendation Report.  [Review the full project description](https://bb9.tamucc.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-3409086-dt-content-rid-44909170_1/xid-44909170_1) (also in the Project 2 folder) and then participate in the &quot;Recommendation Report Q&amp;A&quot; thread in your group discussion board.

This is a substantially revised version of our original planned final project. Considering the variety of ways social distancing has affected us, these changes seemed totally necessary. Please bear with me as we work through a few of the rough edges of the new material I&#39;ve written for the last part of the semester, and as always--let me know if you get stuck or have questions!!

Here&#39;s the &quot;Recommendation Report Q&amp;A&quot; thread prompt:

- For today&#39;s post, you will locate relevant information about this project, assess the task, and make a plan for completing it.
- Before you write your response to this post, review the project description for Project 2. Download the text description, which outlines goals, processes, and requirements for the project.
- Post a reply to this &quot;Recommendation Report Q&amp;A&quot; thread about your understanding of the second major project. Write about your understanding of the assignment and any questions you have about it.
- If you cannot locate a document that you want to analyze and evaluate for this project, here are some possibilities:
  -  [Elementary class newsletter](https://bb9.tamucc.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-3409086-dt-content-rid-45067861_1/xid-45067861_1)
  - [SAPD Annual Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLjsjD7JxC-hg6vK1p3M8MKmcnTbL8L-/view?usp=sharing) or [APD Annual Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18AbY-agwLc7dMBOzKTq1iB9wWpKMG8LR/view?usp=sharing)
  -  [Property management letter](https://bb9.tamucc.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-3409086-dt-content-rid-45068156_1/xid-45068156_1)
- Return to this thread on Thursday evening and Friday. Review your group members&#39; responses and then go back to edit your original post. See if what others have written helps you answer your question. Try to answer questions posted by your fellow students

## Due Thursday, April 16 by 5:00 pm.

1. Read Chapter 8 of _The Essentials of Technical Communication_ (ETC). Take the Chapter 8 quiz, which is due by 5:00 pm on Friday
2. Participate in the Week 12 Forum: &quot;Another Look at Reports.&quot;
  1. Along with Chapter 8 in your textbook, read &quot;[Types of technical reports: An overview&quot;](https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/otherep.html). Both of these resources will help you think about structure, audience, purpose, and content for your own report.
  2. [This Google Drive folder includes a variety of professional and technical reports](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ssc8jXJeNmJCMsV2shKdTC_t2k0zxnSH?usp=sharing). Skim through the folder, select any two reports, and respond the prompt posted in your group&#39;s forum.
  3. Discuss, reply, and respond to your peers&#39; posts later in the week.

## Next Week

You&#39;ll work on defining the characteristics and criteria for your recommendation reports as well as beginning your analysis.

# Week 13

The most imprortant thing you can do to make headway in your final project is to do each of our forum discussion activities as fully and honestly as you can. If you do them all, you&#39;ll be ready to draft the recommendation report. If you skip them or rush through them without much thought, you&#39;ll have little go on by the time peer review comes in two weeks!

## Due Tuesday, April 21 by 5:00 pm

1. Review this _[Open Technical Communication](https://softchalkcloud.com/lesson/serve/3eGFUPbWuwTLHn/html)_ module on Recommendation and Feasibility Reports. It provides details about the general purposes for recommendation, feasibility, and evaluation reports. The module also describes organizational strategies and other features.
2. Participate in the &quot;Week 13: Project 2 thoughts&quot; group forum.
  1. The prompt in that forum is fairly detailed. Discuss your progress in thinking about and planning your recommendation report, and in particular describe 1) the document you&#39;ve chosen to evaluate and 2) some early ideas for &quot;characteristics of good technical writing&quot; you plan to use in your recommendation report.
  2. Write inventively and reflectively, and comment thoughtfully on your peers&#39; posts. What ideas seem most interesting or compelling? What questions do you have for them about their topic? What support can you give?

## Due Thursday, April 23 by 5:00 pm

1. Participate in the &quot;Week 13: Tentative analysis&quot; group forum according to the following prompt:
  1. Share the beginnings of your analysis and evaluation.  [Download the attached &quot;project2-20s-scaffolding.docx&quot; document and save it to your computer](https://bb9.tamucc.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-3409085-dt-content-rid-45071414_1/xid-45071414_1). Add the requested information, save it, and upload the new version to this &quot;Week 13: Tentative Analysis&quot; forum.
  2. In your forum post, write 2-3 lingering questions you have about your characteristics, evaluation, and recommendations. Respond and reply to your peers; answering questions and providing feedback on their materials.

## Next Week

More work on your report. We&#39;ll do audience analysis and get to DRAFTING the thing!

# Week 14

## Due Tuesday, April 28 by 5:00 pm

1. Participate in the Week 14 forum, &quot;Audience Analysis.&quot; This week, you&#39;ll spend some time doing audience analaysis. As Tebeaux and Dragga noted:
  1. _A host of factors determine your readers&#39; perception: education, family, geographical and cultural background, job responsibilities, rank in the organization, age, life experiences, and gender--just to name a few demographics that define how people see the world. How much your readers know about your topic determines what you say and the technical level of your presentation._
  2. Read the following:
    1. ETC Chapter 2: Writing for your readers
    2. [Audience Analysis: Just who are these guys](https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/aud.html)?
  3. Then write about your specific audience for your recommendation report. Answer the following questions
    1. Who is the primary reader for my recommendation report? (Remember--you don&#39;t have to actually send this report to them, but you do need to write as if you were.)
    2. What is the primary reader going to DO with my report?
    3. What is the organization my primary reader works for? What&#39;s their position and title? What is their profession and field?
    4. How much do they know or not know about my topic? (Remember, your topic is both &quot;good technical writing&quot; and the document itself.) Do they have expertise in this area?
    5. Do you know or can you estimate your readers&#39; educational levels?
    6. Will your readers have an interest in what you write?
    7. Why do your readers need what you write?
    8. What kind of relationship do you have with these readers?
    9. What is the reader&#39;s attitude toward you and the subject matter you need to communicate?
    10. Do you have credibility with these readers?
    11. How well do you know your readers?
  4. As you respond to these questions, think about what you&#39;ll need to do to make your message appealing, clear, and persuasive to your readers. Summarize some of your ideas and strategizing here to discuss and clarify with your group.

## Due Thursday, April 30

Nothing due this day. Use the time to draft, draft, draft. Next week will be peer review for your reports!
