# Project 1: High-level Overview of Writing in Your Field

**Background**

The major projects in this course are designed to introduce you to the kinds of writing typical in your discipline or intended profession. Here's the problem&mdash;though I'm an expert in technical communication, I am not an expert in every. single. field. out there. That's where YOU come in&mdash;to apply your own growing disciplinary content knowledge and build on that knowledge to make observations and draw conclusions about professional communication in your field.

Some of you are already working in or have experience in your fields, and this series of projects will serve as an opportunity for you to go deeper on what you've already been introduced to and to hone key writing and research skills. For others, these two projects will serve as an introduction or awakening to the realities of future writing at work and how it may resemble or differ from writing at school.

In this project, you will create two texts: a **fact sheet** and an **informational visualization**.  Together they will present a high-level overview of writing in your chosen field to an unfamiliar, nontechnical audience. To create your texts, research and collect information about the types, or genres, of technical and professional communication that professionals in your intended career create. In general, your fact sheet and visualization will be informative, identifying typical audiences, exigencies, and genres in your field. You'll also need to identify key ethical and social justice issues relevant to writers in your profession. Use the features and strategies of TPC that you're learning about to highlight connections and explain important ideas for your audience.

You will eventually take the information from this project into the second major project, where you will more extensively analyze and compare technical and professional communication in your field.

## Goals

Along with our basic course SLOs (1, 2, 3) our specific goals with this assignment are:

- Practice balancing clarity and concision as you try to describe genres both completely and succinctly for an audience using text and visuals.
- Practice information and document design as you organize your findings in a way that suggests meaningful connections for an audience.
- Learn the characteristics of writing you will typically do in the workplace.
- Identify ethical issues relevant to writing in your field.

## Requirements

Create a **fact sheet** and an **informational visualization**. Together they will present a high-level overview of writing in your chosen field to an unfamiliar, nontechnical audience.

1. Your fact sheet will summarize key information **at least 10 different kinds (genres) of writing**.

2. Your visualization **may be part of your fact sheet** (like a graphic or illustration), **or it may be a standalone text** (such as an infographic or an Instagram story). Either way your visualization must be conceptual or informational, not solely decorative.

In general, both your fact sheet and visualization will be informative, identifying typical audiences, exigencies, and genres in your chosen field. They must also identify key ethical and social justice issues relevant to writers in that profession.

### Content Requirements:

You must include the following content. Some of this material might be covered in one text and not the other (_for example, you might make an infographic about ethics in occupational therapists' writing to go along with your your fact sheet that doesn't cover that material_), or you might choose to make two versions of the same information.

- Short descriptions of **10 types or genres of TPC** in a particular career, job, or field
- **Specific readers** or users for each kind of communication
- **Specific exigences** or purposes for each kind of communication
- **Special features** or characteristics distinctive to each kind of communication
- **Ethical or social justice issues** relevant to the professionals creating the communication

You may include other information you find interesting or relevant in your fact sheet sheet

Respect the intellectual property rights of others by citing or linking to sources or using commons-based instead of copyright-protected content.

### Design Requirements:

You must meet the following design constraints. Your design should help readers use and understand your document and should suggest meaningful connections in the content:

- **Use design elements and graphics** (such as headings, color, layout) to highlight key information, reinforce relationships in your content, and make your fact sheet easy to read and visually appealing.
- **Use text structures** (such as titles, subtitles, footnotes, and other elements) to clarify the audience, purpose, and scope of your text as well as present its content.
- **Format** your fact sheet so that it fits on no more than 2 pages in Word.
- **Proofread** your document; your work should be free from all surface errors.
- *Do not turn in a docuent with double-spaced, 12pt Times New Roman manuscript formatting, a school-type heading, etc.*

This should be written for a nontechnical audience. Think of the audience for this project as someone thinking about entering the profession, career, or discipline.

## Creating your documents

### Step 1: Decide on a career you will focus on for the project

To begin, you must decide on a career field, major, or job that you are interested in. You can choose any career you like. You could also focus on a career related to a job or internship you have had. This should be a professional career that involves professional and technical communication.

### Step 2: Research writing in that career or field

Research the kinds of writing individuals in your chosen career field do and come up with a list that is as comprehensive as possible. Your list will encompass all sorts of writing, from everyday to infrequent, from informal to formal. Don&#39;t overlook social media, as that has become an important venue for technical and professional writing in the 21st century.

Your chart must be the result of **research** , not generalizations you can come up with off the top of your head. You can locate information about writing through a variety of activities:

- interview working professionals
- research in the university library (the library most likely has books about writing in your field)
- research on the Internet (check resources created by professional organizations in your field, government organizations and nonprofits, as well as [trade periodicals and websites](https://youtu.be/ODk6My5y1WA))
- research in academic databases and journals
- examine field [style guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide)

### Step 3: Create your document

Create your fact sheet using MS Word. Word is free to TAMUCC students via [Office 365](http://it.tamucc.edu/Office365/Office365.html). I'm a big Google nerd, but for this assignment do not use Google Docs because formatting options are limited in those tools.

For your visualization, you could create an informative table, an infographic, a poster, or, well, pretty much whatever you can think of! A few tools that might be useful include:
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
- [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com/)

We will have a series of peer review sessions using your group forums and journals where you will get feedback from myself and your classmates that you can apply as you work.

We will look at some examples of fact sheets, but you should strive to make your document **your own**. Rather than make something that is mostly a copy of one of the examples, be creative as you apply concepts we've discussed related to helpful designs, usable illustrations, and readable prose.
