# workplace writing journal prompts for 3301

## journal entry 1

It can be difficult to get really current information about work in some fields through books or even the internet. You can get specific, current knowledge about trends, practices, and skills in career fields by talking to current professionals working in the field. The major projects you'll do later in the semester will partially involve interviews with professionals about the writing they do for their work.

For your first Workplace writing journal entry, write about 250 words, according to the following prompt:

Briefly describe your professional goals; you did this a little bit in the Intro forum, but it's good to put that here at the beginning of this journal, too.
Identify 3 people you could interview, whether in person, by email, or by phone, that you would consider a "workaday writer"--someone who undertakes writing within the scope of their employment. These individuals may or may not identify themselves as "writers," by the way, and that's okay. These should be individuals you could interview later in the term about their professional writing experience. These people do not have to be someone you know already, but must be someone you could reasonably expect to correspond and get a longer interview with sometime in the semester.
What organization do they work for? What do you know already about their job and the organization? What do you already know about the kind of writing they do as part of their professional or community work?
Identify whether those individuals have LinkedIn profiles, professional pages on the company website, etc. Find them, link them, discuss them a bit.
If you can't think of any specific individuals, what are other places you might start looking if you were going to interview a professional writer in that field?

## journal entry 2

Post an entry in your workplace writing journal. You have two options this week--one is if you've found a person you can interview, and one is if you haven't.

For either option, your journal entry should be no shorter than 250 words.

Option A: Go back to your list of professionals to talk to in your workplace writing journal. Choose one, and ask them to describe their most important dos and don'ts for work-related email or text messaging. Post the information you get from them as a new entry in your workplace writing journal, and reflect on what you learned from them and how that aligns or not with your own e-mail experiences.
Option B: Search the internet for at least three advice or how-to articles on workplace or professional email. (Here's a starter for you, from the Heroic Technical Writing blog). Provide links to each article, and briefly summarize the content. What are some of the most important principles for work email you read about? These don't have to just be style tips, but also workplace culture tips like how frequently to check email, when to do email, etcetera.

## journal entry 3

Post an entry in your workplace writing journal. You again have two options this week--one is if you've found a person you can interview, and one is if you haven't.  For either option, your journal entry should be no shorter than 250 words.

Option A: Go back to your list of professionals to talk to in your workplace writing journal. When they need information specifically related to the writing and reporting they do as part of their job, where do they search? Do they use specialized databases or reference sources, or do they navigate the internet for information? Do they interview other experts, or use other sources of information? Report on your findings in your journal.

Option B: Find information about at least thee professional associations or organizations someone in your profession might be a member of. These might be international, national, regional, state, or local organizations. (For example. a technical writer might be a member of the Society for Technical Communication.) Provide links to each professional association's website, and  summarize the content that's provided there. What resources do these wbesites provide? What kinds of reports, fact sheets, or other documents do they publish? Is there a social media presence? Report on your findings in your journal.
