# Tutoring Technical Writing Workshop  
A workshop for CASA Writing Center @ TAMUCC
November 04, 2022

## First principles:
Tutoring Engineering and Technical Writing is the same as tutoring everything else. Tutors should:
1. read and assess based on rhetorical concepts: audience, purpose, context
1. be able to interact in a comfortable, non-hierarchical manner with writers
1. be positive and ask effective questions
1. recognize the difference between helping and editing; directive and non-directive tutoring
  - "Include a table in this section" vs "Tables help readers comprehend large data sets"
1. effectively distinguish between HOCs and LOCs
1. have a grasp of grammatical rules and myths
1. do it all in half an hour the day before the thing is due
