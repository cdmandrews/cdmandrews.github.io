#List of faculty self-identified strengths
(edited)

I'm good at a few things:
- Listen closely
- Show empathy.
- Help build to-do lists
- Project positivity.
- redirecting destructive discourse (“gossip”) into constructive discourse for a positive environment. It’s this last one “constructive discourse” that I feel I need to explain a bit more. This is what I notice. Often, when I meet with students, students want to speak poorly or vent frustrations about other professors in our college or at our university. I begin to listen carefully to their concerns. If about pedagogy, I am quick to redirect the conversation by indicating that those matters should be made directly to that instructor, and I say no more. If about personality and/or personal, I stop the conversation immediately by saying that I will not engage in such discourse and voice my support for the instructor as a member of our academic community. This is just something I’ve noticed about the student/professor culture these past few years. I want to show students that we all support one another. This vision I draw from the community college I came from in SA. 
 
I think I help students to learn more about themselves. I draw this from Anzaldúa. She tells us we are our language. Therefore, if we want to learn more about how to use language, then we have to learn more about who we are in that language.
 
been able to work with so many in the short time I’ve been here. I’m always the first to offer help. I admit that at times I take on too much, but I have a fear that if I don’t do it, then I won’t learn from it.
 
establishing networks or connecting people with other people. I admit I have not done much outreach to the community here in CC, but the few times I have I’ve been able to bridge community resources from SA to CC. I had SA authors visit CC. I asked SA stakeholders donate materials to centers in CC. I asked personal friends from SA to cover the cost of materials for a Barrio Writer’s workshop.
 
in the coastal bend community Latinx, especially working-class Latinx, are devalued, seen as less than, presumed incompetent, and subjected to discrimination.

- My strength is perseverance.
- My strength is caretaking.
- My strength is helping others see a larger picture.
- My strength is helping students with their research.
- My strength is connecting concepts from multiple disciplines.
- My strength is innovation.
- My strength is creativity.
 
I came to TAMUCC for my MA because the surrounding schools knew that if anyone wanted to teach writing, especially at a college level, then getting an MA from TAMUCC was essential. What’s our identity now? I hope we do things and move in ways that go beyond the discipline of English and Rhetoric and Composition.
 
encouraging them to use their strengths to be the best they can be.

learn how to think critically and independently.

developed new programs and mentored students to continue on to MA/PhD programs.
developing relationships that have allowed students to work on real world writing.
they ask us to look at issues and see things that we are unaware of and need to be challenged/changed.

- Encouraging others
- Seeing the big picture and planning for the long term
- Researching
- Working one on one with students

My research and creative writing (poetry and nonfiction) in feminism (radical to postmodern) and ecofeminism, and also currently the Karankawans from Matagorda Bay to Corpus Christi Bay (1550s 1800s) explores topics that I think are valuable because:  my work seeks to expand our knowledge of our own coastal and borderland history and connect us to the multidimensional lives of our ancestors in their complex beauty and violence, their challenges and their achievements.  I hope to reimagine Karankawan history and culture and render the lives of these ancestors as authentically as possible in my poetry.  Writing poetry requires the similar movements of scholars in examining and interpreting history and culture and/or reclaiming lost voices and unrecognized perspectives. Through the lyric narrative imagination, poets illuminate our history, our values, our culture, our multidimensional, intersectional beingness, our alternative universes and ideas. Together with the scholars, we expand our knowledge, our understanding, and our wisdom so that me might go thoughtfully forward to create and cultivate among ourselves and our communities, local and global, a healthier, more vibrant, inclusive, respectful, harmonious, fulfilling way of living and being. This shapes the way I think about teaching

listening. Asking questions and waiting through long pauses, long breathing spaces for students to ask questions, talk, discover what they are thinking and how they want to express it. (One of my research projects during the MA was observing student-teacher interaction in the classroom and one-one, and all of my data revealed the teacher dominates the talking. So I'm conscientious about this, and when I hear myself talking too much, I wince and nip it in the bud.) This overlaps with the next one 

help students to feel and know that their voice, their experiences, and their words matter to themselves and others, and  

encouraging students out of their comfort zones, to trust me and one another and to take the risks in writing that push their boundaries (or to be willing to work within safe boundaries, such as received form in poetry) in order to discover more through language for themselves and their audience, more feeling, more intellectual awareness, which is imbued with compassion, and 

study learning theory and how students learn in this digital age, which is different than how I grew up without so much instant interactive technology. I'm interested to know the research that reveals, for example, that I have about five to eight minutes at the beginning of class to do any "lecturing" after which point, the student is no longer focused on my words. So, this makes me good at keeping students interacting with their writing, published writing, and one another, and to stay thrilled or intrigued, on our good and best days. (Somedays, it feels like a crap shoot), and  

creating new curriculum that reflects the contemporary literary publishing establishments and shifting landscapes, and try new texts and writing exercises. I love to write the exercises with my students and I love our synergy, inspiring and being inspired through and with them, and 

editor, co-founded and also helped to transform two significant journals that will provide a space for our students to find a voice or role in, either through publication or editorial roles. On the new Windward Review, students are an integral part in the vision and the whole editorial process of making good literature and art that provides a space for new, emerging, and recognized writers and something they can be really proud being a part of

built bridges and relationships among colleagues across many disciplines in the CLA and other colleges. I'm proud that I've helped to enhance the creative writing community by instituting the Fall Festival through the Switchgrass Review, by becoming a Faculty Advisor for the Islander Creative Writers, and worked hard for their opportunities to express themselves and gain confidence in their work through their communities at readings, festivals. I'm proud of being on the core committee with the Peoples Poetry Festival and all this has brought together with students and faculty and community to show how living creative writers contribute to knowledge, thought. This overlaps with the outreach to community

partnering with community organizations and institutions that appreciate language and art. For example, I'm on the Board of Directors for the Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation, and we meet twice a month or more; and they are our publisher for the Switchgrass Review: a journal of women's health, history, and empowerment. They are working so hard in addressing the health disparities among women in our community and they value the literary space for gathering, exploring, healing. I've also partnered with high schools for workshops and the Coastal Bend Writing Project in facilitating writing workshops to high school teachers. 
 
Listening to their interests and helping them to shape a paper topic that is both connected to the class and to their experiences/goals. I am also good at helping students identify opportunities that will build their resumes and prepare them for a number of professional futures.
 
Understand literary works in their historical contexts and to carefully articulate the ways in which they resonate with our present moment.
 
Helped to build departmental culture among our students and faculty and to create more visibility for the English department on campus and in the community.
 
Making Shakespeare and literature more generally accessible and relevant various groups of people, including teachers, students, and other members of our community.
 
Issues of translation and language intersect with all of the disciplines that make up English Studies, and thinking about the long history of contact between languages and cultures is incredibly important in our globalized world today, especially here in the borderlands.
 
My work on the drama of Shakespeare and his contemporaries is also important because Shakespeare plays a major role in high school curricula today, and I believe I can equip students who are either already teachers or aspiring teachers to teach his works in exciting and culturally relevant ways.

helping them see their strengths as a writer.

I want students to learn skills rather than information. In writing classes, I distinguish critical thinking from motivated reasoning by beginning the semester studying cognitive biases that lead to persuasive but faulty arguments. In literature classes, I assign texts that make different narrative interpretations when telling the same or parallel stories. This forces students to confront the middle layer narrative places between the reader and the story. Developing these skills makes students more self-aware when consuming or generating arguments and narratives.

I’m really good at helping them discover the complexity and originality of their own thought. I like challenging them to expect more of themselves as writers, thinkers, and citizens. 

When teaching online can make students feel they are not invisible.

I do a good job of explaining what works for me, and why it works, in terms of writing or arguing or reading strategies. 

I help students to become more independent and self-guided readers of texts. 
 
I view myself as far more than a teacher of First Year students; I am their coach, their cheer leader, and their fiercest advocate.
 
TAMUCC makes a difference in people’s lives.  You have a student who comes to campus, who comes from a background that has not been privileged.  That student gets a degree, and gets a professional job and suddenly has possibilities that they never imagined.  I can name former students that were never covered by health insurance until after they graduated.  Sometimes, other family members see this student’s success, and they, too, come to college.  I can tell you one student, from a humble background, who came here and got her degree.  Her sister saw it was possible, and she came and got a degree has well.  Inspired by her two daughters, Mom came to school ad got a degree.  All three work as educators, and have moved from marginal financial circumstances to comfortable middle-class existence.  (The two daughters were English majors, BTW)

My students often praise my enthusiasm about texts and ideas.   I think this helps students to see that excitement is a valuable place to being literary scholarship; they also comment directly that my enthusiasm helps them feel excitement or urgency about the material. For example, students in my grammar classes often commented that I made “even grammar” interesting because of my own delight and curiosity.

In my classes, I try to help students become more comfortable with participating in and ultimately leading discussions with their peers, with the goal of using this process to help them feel more confident in talking and writing about their interpretations of the texts we read. 
 
I help students to see that writing is challenging for everyone, even professional writers, and help them to find ways to make writing far less of a daunting task.

Attending TAMUCC irrevocably alters our students’ lives for the better.

Since we focus on process-based pedagogy in First Year Writing, I feel I am good at guiding students through each step of the writing process. In terms of working one-on-one with students, I really enjoying having conferences with small groups to discuss their drafts. Students are more comfortable asking questions in this setting, and they usually visit me more often during office hours as a result. 

I create space for students to choose their own objects of study as much as possible. In writing classes, this means finding an issue that is relevant to each and becoming an expert in that issue over the course of the semester. In literary survey classes, this means allowing students to choose between works of literature. Their essays, assignments, and tests are then limited to the texts they have selected for personal focus.

I've built a truly integrated learning experience for my students in the First Year Learning Community Program.  My pedagogical approach is now used in other First Year Learning Communities, and has been nationally recognized.

I’ve been able to generate enthusiasm in the classroom around difficult topics (e.g. race, very old literature, theory). One of the effects of this enthusiasm is the ability of students to have conversations about the larger implications of what we read and study for the world in which we live. 
 
Technical writing is the glue, or the connective tissue, that helps students apply the skills they learn in humanities courses to the job market.

My curriculum development in First Year Writing has enabled those declared science majors to be able to be more successful in upper level writing opportunities.

As an instructor, I help students understand the power of words and the reasons that English studies is important as a tool to comprehend and navigate our ever-changing culture.

As a teacher of online classes and a member of ITDEC, I model my classes on popular MOOCs such as those offered by EdX and Coursera. This means a mixture of readings, video lectures, and peer-to-peer forum posts. The goal is a multimedia interaction that can balance the focus on text.

Establishing rapport, a working relationship based in trust and dialogue. I've directed some very different independent projects that depended more on relationship and feedback (and expertise as a writer/teacher of writing) than it did on expertise in the student's subject

My students seem to find value in my classes; when a former student contacts me and tells me how she used something in her life or work that she learned in my class, I’m very happy.

I teach a core class, so I have to make sure students "buy in," and I think I help them realize how crucial writing is to their academic success. I really enjoy working in learning communities because I am able to help students develop their writing skills, and I help them with the transition of high school to college as well.  
 
Teaching makes it worth getting out of bed.  Never once in my (mumbled number) of years teaching have I not thought my job is worth doing.  Helping students take in the world around them through words, think about that world thoughtfully, and shape that world by their own writing, speaking and thoughts—it’s the foundation not only for all education, but, to me, for everything else.  Our words and language shape who we are.  Rhetoric is the study of the power of words.   Helping students understand that power, and to use it wisely and well—what better job is there?
 
I focus on building close reading and close looking analysis skills in my graduate courses.  In my courses, I have a lot of assignments that are designed to foster close attention to HOW literary texts construct meaning through their formal features and how those formal elements enhance the content of the text.  I ground these analytical skills within historical contexts of textual production and circulation using book covers, correspondence about publishing, early reviews, and advertisements. 

I am most proud of the success I’ve had implementing service learning projects in all of my courses and thus giving my students the chance to apply the concepts they’re learning to the concrete world around them.

My classes are challenging. Students need to work hard and are not guaranteed good grades, but they learn a tremendous amount and grow a tremendous amount.

I think I’m good at broadening horizons by bringing my experiences as a teacher/language learner in Guyana, Nicaragua, and South Korea into the classroom. I hope it shows them what is possible and encourages them to have their own adventures.

 One of my strengths is explaining complex ideas to students in ways they can understand.

listening to student concerns and helping them find/clarify their own ideas.

I want my classes to be spaces of defamiliarization. While students may feel more comfortable bringing isolated elements into their familiar worldviews, I encourage them to step out of those worldviews and examine literature or rhetoric in the historical and cultural contexts that first produced them. To that end, I bring relevant contextual information from history, archaeology, sociology, anthropology, etc. to the class.

I'm effective at instilling trust so that students view me as approachable and interested in their success. 

My classes and my research have real world applications. They involve language in use and language in society and students can connect what is learned in class to their lives in very real ways.
   
find ways to use writing for their own purposes. Realize that writing is something they can do and do well. Think about audience. Think about language in a contextualized way.
 
draw their own conclusions…complete complex tasks independently by scaffolding learning throughout and being very well organized.

I feel that I’m really good at creating a relaxed yet engaging classroom space where students feel comfortable discussing complex topics.
   
Write real things for real audiences, expand technical and rhetorical toolboxes, and develop agency with discourse and technologies to engage in rhetorical action.
My main drive as a teacher is to help my students sense that they have agency—the capacity to use their existing knowledge and skills to act and gain new knowledge and skills, whether those are centered in a professional ecology or an academic one.

  helping them push their work in new directions. My research on spatial theory and city studies provides students with ways of confronting and understanding everyday life, and I like encouraging them to see the world around them in new ways. This often comes out in their writing as they develop a theoretical vocabulary that allows them to take on complex ideas from new perspectives. 

being accessible
being supportive

  I help students view writing as a valuable skill in their future endeavors when they will be competing in their professional lives to fund research, start projects, buy equipment, promote causes. 

  I help to students to see that their ideas, interpretations, and experiences have value and deserve to be heard. To that end, out of all my interests and research projects, I try to teach the questions and material that is relevant to current political issues so that students can connect what we learn to our community. 

  my excitement for the material that I am teaching serves as a source of energy and motivation for my students.

I integrate concepts and examples from a range of disciplines. After examining literature or rhetoric through these interdisciplinary methods, students are better able to export those insights into still other disciplines.

I have worked to incorporate interdisciplinary resources on campus working with colleagues in the art department to work with their printing equipment (using hands-on activities to teach them about histories of illustration, having students make their own etchings, and exposing them to a range of printing technologies).  

I help students to think in deeper ways about complex ideas. I understand that I have a reputation for being a "tough" professor, but I this being a result of the high level of rigor to which I hold my students. 
 
I have been successful converting students from “I hate writing” attitudes to acceptance and even belief just by spending time talking to them about topics until I spark their interest.   

I’m good at helping students understand and value the ‘applied’ aspect of “applied linguistics”. For instance, I think I’m good at helping them see how theory and research should inform and guide the pedagogical choices they make as language teachers.

I work to develop their ideas about their papers or their exam listing by asking them a lot of questions and having them reflect about the elements of the text, question, list that they find most animating. 

I’m good at showing my passion and love for courses/content I teach and bringing that passion into the classroom. 
 
 I have a lot of experience working with students and faculty, and I try to be a good listener to their concerns 

helping students to clarify their ideas in speech and writing. I love helping students to think about literature and culture in new ways, and I think that I am able to discern what interests students by listening attentively to them and helping them to turn their sharp insights into sustained arguments. 

I try to help students see the bigger picture in their work. 

hone their critical thinking and writing skills. I like to develop supportive communities in my classrooms in which the solitary experience of reading literature and theory becomes a communal endeavor that enables students to think about the world in new ways.

As a member of the university community, I’m proud of the interdisciplinary relationships I have had the opportunity to build.

I have big shoulders and a small ego.  These are essential qualities in higher education.

been professional and focused on student needs.

Advocated for user-centered (which may be student-centered or may be staff-centered, but is always people-centered) technological systems in university communities. Applied data  and rhetoric to effect positive change.

In terms of service, I like to think of myself as an “idea” person (someone who helps to generate ideas about how we can move forward as a department), but I think more importantly than that I’m good at providing structures within which a common vision for progress can be achieved. In other words, I like to think I’m easy to work with, put the goals of the English Department before my own, and am willing to compromise. I think everyone does great work that can feel like it goes unrecognized, and I’d like to ameliorate that by inviting faculty to give guest lectures on their research, chatting in the hallways about what they’re teaching or researching, and supporting their events on campus. 

Mentored students, former students, and colleagues. Contributed to the maintenance of the CompPile bibliographic database of writing studies research.

As a colleague (and as a person), I have worked hard to develop an understanding of professional, appropriate, and healthy patterns of communication so that ego and the need for approval do not get in the way of putting the students first.

I strongly believe in the discipline of English studies as a whole, and I think have a clear sense of how Rhetoric, Literature, Linguistics, Composition, Creative Writing, and Technical Writing fit together and compliment one another.

worked with students who have been less than enthusiastic about writing but have thrived in my class. This is especially uplifting when former students who are ready to graduate stop me on campus and thank me for my part in their success.

Since I was the first Professional Faculty in the Department to be promoted, in sharing my experiences I am able to be a mentor to others.

When serving the university as a co-organizer of our Interdisciplinary Graduate Symposium, I'm proud of the work my co-organizers and I have done to try to start conversations at our university across disciplines, and to bridge those conversations with students and faculty at other universities in the region.

I'm also proud of my long service as an editor in print and multimodal scholarly texts, serving the discipline in publication and circulation of accessible, open-access scholarship of the highest quality.

I’m most proud of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that TAMUCC students and faculty have raised on behalf of area nonprofs.   

In my service to campus communities, I work hard to foster and support community goals through my time, energy, and conceptual contributions. That is, I see my strength in service as building on the communities that we already value and support based on my own experiences or expertise.

I feel that I have a strength in organizing events that help students understand the connection between the learning in my literature courses and their passions and interests in popular culture. 

Depending on my role on a committee, I do try to keep it focused on the task at hand so people feel like we are accomplishing something and that it is not a waste of time.

cultivated professional networks that foster intellectual exchange and mentorship among students, scholars, and community members from a variety of backgrounds. 

I did not accept the role of HHM coordinator because I thought it would look good on my faculty activity report; I accepted this role because this is something that is very important to me. This region was once part of Mexico, and we are an HSI, so I think it is vital we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month and educate other about our history. Representation is so important, and I strive to create a calendar of events that features events coordinated by various departments. When you are a person of color, there are certain, stereotypical roles you are expected to fill, and I want to show all students that they are capable of pursuing a career in any field. Seeing someone like me in the authoritative roles of Professor and HHM Coordinator shows students that they are not restricted by their backgrounds, despite what counselors or teachers may have told them. I am proud of how the Hispanic Heritage Month calendar has expanded over the years, and I hope to continue this trend.

  made valuable personal and professional connections with my students and my colleagues. I commit myself to my job, and I value the various ways I can make a positive impact on those people with whom I come in contact. 

I’m pleased that in my service to the community, I’ve had the opportunity to bring faculty from multiple disciplines, community business leaders, and local charities together for a common cause.

In professional contexts, my goal is to promote sociable exchange that is accessible to students and scholars at all levels. My approach to service is driven by accessibility and inclusivity. 

pushing back against discourses that sometimes frame international students for their deficiencies rather than strengths But similar discourses are of our students “problems” and “weaknesses” are common; I try to speak against those. 

 advocating for international students and helping others understand the complexity of second language writing and language acquisition. I think I’m a collegial, team-player that works well with others.

 the value of a regional university like TAMUCC lies in its commitment to the community, and I’ve been glad to lead discussions or host high school students that connect what we do to what is happening in Corpus Christi. 

The thing that I am most proud about TAMUCC is the many and deep connections it has with the community.  From Hispanic Heritage month, to the way the TPW program connects with community agencies in meaningful ways, to way our faculty has embraced various student populations, to the relationships our faculty develop and maintain with teachers I the area, many of whom are former students, to Authors Day, which provides many low-income students with their first experience on a college campus—ours is not an Ivory Tower department.  It’s a vital part of both the university community and of Corpus Christi as well.

Since I am from this community, it is important for me to invite local Latinos who are making an impact to our campus. Yes, we need to learn about and celebrate past and present Latinos who are making an impact on the national level, but there are so many people in our own community who are making a difference. I invited the leaders of the non-profit organizations, MAP of Texas and the South Texas Colonia Initiative, to speak about their work because they serve the most vulnerable members of our community. And, after their discussions, they are approached by students from various organizations who would like to volunteer.   I also invited local Chicana artist, Mayra Zamora to speak about her work, which you can find all over the downtown area, as well as the creators of the clothing brands, Taco Gear and Sew Bonita, because all of these individuals are making an impact in their respective areas. We also invited Professor Renato Ramirez to speak about the court case that led to this campus becoming part of the A&M system, and everyone at this institution needs to know and understand this history. There are many other events I could discuss, but I fear this email will never end...

I have worked hard to establish professional, working relationships with three language learning communities/organizations here in town (off campus). These relationships are built on mutual respect.

providing professional development to teachers, advising in program administration, supporting language learning students (3 different schools; 3 different age ranges).

serving on the board of the Corpus Christi Montesssori School (CCMS), a public, open enrollment charter school established by parents and educators.

finding ways to bring the community onto campus, especially in terms of the LGBTQ community.

I am proud of fostering and supporting the women’s, gender, and sexuality studies program, sigma tau delta, and the english club and working on events and discussions with these groups to foster feminist discussion of art and popular culture. 

providing support to various clubs and student organizations. I see this as one of the ways I can impact the lives of students at the university. I've learned that some of the best mentoring opportunities arise out of relationships formed outside of the classroom. 

contribute to the arts as a continuing member of the Art Museum of South Texas and the Corpus Christi Literary Reading Series.

it offers ways of looking at the cultural histories of marginalized peoples in nuanced and facilitative ways. We know relatively little about the history of people with disabilities, and I enjoy decoding literary texts and theorizing about those pasts, and speculating about how those pasts inform our present.

 corpus-aided approaches to language pedagogy because I believe many resources for    and approaches to language learning and teaching are based on limited or even incorrect         understanding of language use.
environmental discourse because I believe we too often overlook and undervalue the     mediating force language has on how we perceive and act towards the environment.

it identifies and explores underlying and pervasive ideological constructs that shape access to education and other governmental institutions for many Americans.

explores spatial theory and city studies. This research is valuable because the experience of everyday life in the 21st century is increasingly the experience of life in the city. At the same time, cities are increasingly becoming the arena in which various political programs are enacted, from the politics of exclusion to the politics of resistance. My research provides ways of understanding this environment through literature. 

 the standards I have set for the quality of my work (in terms of research methodologies, scope of questions asked, and quality of writing) are in line with the top of my field. That is, I set my expectations based on the top of my field as opposed to the expectations of the CLA, the or the department of English here at TAMUCC. 

  they address inequities that were a problem in early America and continue to be an issue today. I tend to tell people I work on epidemic disease in American literature because it is an easy way to state the topic, but I think what’s important about this area of study is how disease has always been a signifier for working through difference and the parameters of communal belonging. What was a “race” issue in 1720 when Cotton Mather learned how to inoculate against smallpox from an African slave is still a race issue in the early 20th century when blackness is cast as synonymous with infectiousness and undergirds why we need a #BlackLivesMatter movement today. Sometimes a sociopolitical problem cannot be understood without tracing out its decades-long genealogies--which is challenging--and that is why I still believe in traditional academic research. Universities and the kinds of publications associated with them provide the time and space within which to do this kind of critical work, and I’m glad to be a part of it. 

Technology and rhetoric are the air we breathe; writing is the air we breathe. Thinking about writing as technology and how it instantiates culture, ideology, and practices is a fundamental part of living, having families, working, teaching, and advocating in today’s attention economy.
 
 digs into the value of social networks--especially digital social networks--for professionalization, circulation of scholarly knowledge, and advancement of people in the academy. Understanding how we use technology to invent our professional selves is useful for students and academics alike as we confront an ever-more-thickly networked culture.

They have to do with student learning, language, ethnicity, strategies for success. Developmental writing, first-year programs and writing centers are all transitional spaces, places where students might get help feeling like they belong and can be successful in college.

My research interests and the subjects I teach are fresh and “sexy” and result in student interest in literature and writing, and a wider knowledge of the possibilities for studies in English.

my research helps students see the relevance that their lives, their words, and their actions can have on the outside work. 

I’m as excited about our department as I was when I was in my first job as a late-twenties assistant professor.  The changes that have happened in the world—the new medias, the changes in public discourse, the gains and losses in education—have created new challenges.  But these challenges are challenges that the discipline of English can meet head on; I’ve never felt the work we do was more needed and more relevant than it is now.  This, by the way, is why I’m always driving forward to try new things.  I’ll be the first to admit that driving forward isn’t always the best strategy, but English has much to do, and it should look forward and embrace the future rather than look back.

I try hard to do scholarship and teaching that I believe has ethical components as anti-racist, anti-sexist, and committed to social equality. 

My official workload is 80% teaching/20% service, so I really do not have time to sit down and write about the research topics I am interested in. But, since I work in learning communities I try to keep up with the scholarship on learning communities, integrative assignments, and first year writing as much as possible. My background is in Rhetoric and Composition, so I also try to keep with the scholarship on these topics, but I am really interested in how rhetoric is used in the media. More specifically, I explore research on the rhetoric surrounding menstruation and marketing for various menstrual products, the rhetoric of rap/hip-hop and how this is usually portrayed in the media in a negative light, and finally the rhetoric of tv shows and movies geared towards children. As a parent of a Mexistinian daughter, the way gender roles and cultures are presented in tv shows and movies really interests me, and I like to look at how these shows use rhetoric to educate/sway/indoctrinate children.  

My current research interests in online learning helps me make interesting and interactive courses, using current technology.

 bridge texts and fields that are usually separated by distances in geography or time period, most notably in my work on Victorian literature and histories of slavery and empire. I see this research as valuable because it helps us understand how we all can be ethically and historically connected to others in ways we might not yet understand or think about everyday. I also see this research as valuable because it shows us that classic works of literature were always influenced by the lives and thinking of those who are treated as marginalized figures in those works or in the time periods when they are written and that a culture is always comprised of a diverse range of voices and ideas.
 
As a former broadcast journalist and technical writer, I bring real world writing expertise to the department.
