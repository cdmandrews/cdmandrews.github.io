# Tutoring Technical Writing Workshop  

At some level, tutoring engr/tech writing is the same as tutoring everything else:
1. read/asses based on rhetorical concepts
2. have a grasp of grammatical rules and myths
3. be able to interact in a comfortable, nonheirarchical manner with writers
4. be nonevaluative in questions and comments
5. be positive and ask effective questions
6. recognize the difference between helping and editing
7. recognize the uses of directive and nondirective tutoring
8. effectively distinguish between HOCs and LOCs
9. do it all in half an hour the day before the writer's thing is due

Tech/Scientific writing students in engineering have special challenges:
 - Students have either not learned or have forgotten the grammar needed to understand effective writing strategies.
 - Students don't understand their audiences: who those audiences are, what they know, and what they are reading.
    - Based on previous schooling experience, students often assume the reader knows more than they do about their subjects. Instead, the student is the knowledge expert in their case and thus must work hard to communicate to others (even with much experience in the field).
    - This can be to your asset--your job can be to be an "expert reader" rather than an expert writer. You don't have to know about the subject to tell when the writer is being murky. Your job can be to dramatize the presence of the audience. (This is supported in tutoring scholarship). But don't use that as an excuse to default to surface-level concerns like pronouns and semicolons.
  - Students struggle with precision at the sentence level.
    - Imprecision (right word, right level of detail) vs Unclear writing (i.e. not following "one idea, one sentence", or using "facilitate" when "help" will do as well.)
  - Style of scientific/technical writing has aspects that students have not encountered in their previous education: Sections, Equations, Illustrations, and highly specific formats.

  - Exacerbating all that: Engineering faculty commonly feel as if it's not really their space to teach writing. They value good writing, but prioritize technical content (due to deeply specific accreditation expecations) and don't feel there's "time" for communication instruction. Or faculty may not feel confident in their own ability to teach writing.


The biggest distinction between technical writing/communication and the other kinds of writing you have done (especially related to the university) is that TC has a different focus on audience and purpose.
  - Most academic writing is about showing a single reader (the instructor) that the the writer has mastered a subject matter or skill (whether that's an interpretive methodology, a particular body of content knowledge, or a particular structure of argumentation)
  - In TC, audience is rarely "people who know as much or more about the subject than you" --it might include peers or supervisors and even more frequently people outside your org. Your purpose might be to:
    - help others learn about a subject, carry out a task, or make a decision
    - motivate readers to take action, or reinforce/change attitudes
  - While the default purpose for most university-related writing is persuasion, in technical disciplines the default purpose is informing.
  - Most technical documents have a clearly-defined audience. Usually they have multiple audiences with different purposes, knowledge bases, and needs--all of which must be served at once. So with any technical document, we must ask ourselves two sets of questions:
    1. Who are the readers? What problem/s are they trying to solve? How much do they (not) know about the subject?
    2. What will readers DO with the document?
  - The easy part is that for now, most ENGR students in our programs write a fairly limited set of mostly-connected genres

Technical writing has three characteristics:
  1. emphasis on clarity and concision
  2. dependence on numbers/quantitative subject matter
  3. reliance on visuals

Writing in Technical/Scientific contexts vs Writing in Academic/Humanistic contexts
    Define purpose and scope vs Background and thesis
    Inform vs Persuade
    Don't oversell hard rules about formality and first-person pronouns. They're not that hard. "We" is especially useful in metadiscourse sections of collaborative writing. If instructors get bogged down in murky and imprecise prose, that's when they'll slam on "I" and "we."
    Writing is not an assignment--it's a speech act that can affect the real world (helping someone follow a procedure, make or change a decision, decide between competing ideas/proposals
    Visual and visual-textual elements make meaning. Headings, lists, visuals, etc.
    Big idea up top.
    Don't buy the myth: use active voice when possible. If not possible, be familiar with the reverse paramedic method.
    Be brief, be correct, be gone.

Humanities and academic writing conventions:
 - long paragraphs, infrequent section headings
 - infrequent lists and tables
 - verbal representation of data rather than visual
PTSC writing conventions:
 - short paragraphs with frequent descriptive section headings
 - frequent lists and tables
 - visual representation of data rather than verbal



Balancing the tutorial desire/mandate to build students' confidence in themselves as (technical) writers and promote independent decision-making WITH the need to be direct and directive.
  - "Tables help readers comprehend large data sets" vs "Include a table in this section."
