At some level, tutoring Engineering and Technical Writing is the same as tutoring everything else:
1. read and assess based on rhetorical concepts: audience, purpose, context
2. have a grasp of grammatical rules and myths
3. be able to interact in a comfortable, non-hierarchical manner with writers
4. be positive and ask effective questions
5. recognize the difference between helping and editing; directive and non-directive tutoring
  - "Tables help readers comprehend large data sets" vs "Include a table in this section."
6. effectively distinguish between HOCs and LOCs
  - Don't freak out and default to comma splices because you don't understand the concepts. They're here to work on explaining it to you--the work of explaining will help them in their writing!
7. do it all in half an hour the day before the thing is due
