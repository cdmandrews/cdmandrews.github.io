<h2>Faculty self-identified strengths</h2>
	<p>This word cloud was generated with <a href="http://voyant-tools.org" target="_blank">Voyant Tools</a> for work with MA Recruitment ad hoc, Fall 2017.</p>
	<p> I thought a distant reading might be useful as part of our process of crystallizing our common identity as a department. I took the data collected from the self-identified strengths document and dropped it in plaintext. To focus on what's represented in our comments themselves, I took out much of the starter text from Kelly's questionnaire ("When working one-on-one with students, I'm really good at..."). This cut approximately 600 words from the corpus. </p>
	<p>The result is quick and dirty, but, I hope, useful. </p>

<h2>Faculty identity from publications</h2>
	<p>First I wanted to listen at the level of keywords; I used identified keywords for those publications tagged with them or created keywords for pubs after a hasty scan. These are based only on the most-recent (?) single texts posted to the Blackboard folder. (If really interested in the list of keywords, .</p>

	<p>To tease out the overlaps, I wrote the following mashup text, identifying common cross-sites in the list as I prepared it. The mashup undoubtedly leaves something cool out; it's just the remains of my noticing.</p> 
	<p><strong>TRANS border cultural work in the public sphere; crossing borders and boundaries with bodies as sites of geo-eco-social-linguisti-cultural crossings; delivery and instruction and crossing big with small institutions with disciplines and bodies (people) in the middle; generational-linguistic bi-trans-queer-identities; place and legitimacy of identities and place in borderlands; words words words. </strong></p>

<h3>Word cloud 1: Keywords from grad faculty</h3>
<p></p><p>In this and the following word cloud, be careful with repetitions, which may stem from similar keywords in the same text; still, there are some clear commonalities that many of us might agree typify our work.</p>
