  <h2>Proposal to adopt student-maintained e-portfolios for program assessment</h2>
  <p>
      Instead of course-based portfolios that students make and then forget about from course to course (in some cases even having multiple portfolios for different courses), or ones that they rush to compile at the end of their time in the program <strong>UG English majors/minors would develop and maintain a single portfolio using the digital platform of their choice focused on their entire time in the program.</strong> </p>
  <p>
      Students’ full portfolios would become part of capstone course deliverables, would be usable for program assessment, and ideally would be of such quality that students could use them in professional or graduate applications. </p>
  <p>
      These portfolios would be focused on the major or program and may be integrated into individual course deliverables at instructor discretion. Not all English courses (in particular service courses) would be required to utilize the adopted system. However, all courses and all instructors would be responsible for some aspect of teaching and reminding English majors and minors to update their digital portfolios and engage in reflection.</p>
  <p>
      Tools students might adopt to deliver portfolios include WordPress, wikis, custom-built HTML/CSS sites, WYSIWYG services, GitHub repositories, Google sites, etc. </p>
  <p>
      In order to facilitate this process, we would need to develop a common set of instructional materials and examples, which instructors could either adopt or iterate on. These instructions would specify how students collect, select, reflect, format, and submit portfolios, enabling students to connect their work to program outcomes themselves. Along with such materials as individual faculty have already developed, we could choose to adopt resources such as <cite>Portfolio Keeping: A Guide For Students</cite> (the 3rd edition of this Bedford text is < $11.00, and used copies for all editions start at $1.00; adoption would not put additional financial stress on students).</p>
  </p>
  <p>Needed action from ENGL faculty:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Accept, reject, or revise this proposal for student-maintained e-portfolios.</li>
      <li>Develop timeline for next steps.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If accepted,</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Normal assessment planning. Determine which ENGL outcome(s) we want to assess for. Write assessment plan including goals and criteria for measurement, records maintenance, how long we’ll measure the particular outcome, etc. WEAVE, etc. </li>
      <li>Develop standards of performance and portfolio examples at high, middle, and low standards. </li>
      <li>Develop or select standard language or instructional materials that specify how students will collect, select, reflect, format, and submit.</li>
      <li>Pilot?</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Strengths of student-maintained e-portfolios:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Portfolios become opportunities for rhetorical and creative experience rather than just fodder for assessment drudgery. </li>
    <li>Students will have choice (and with instruction, agency) in determining the right platform for delivery and circulation; they will have the ability to design, redesign, and even change platforms as their abilities and needs change. </li>
    <li>Students will have multiple opportunities to learn about and reflect on the nature of digital composition, information management, identity, delivery, circulation, mediation, and other technorhetorical considerations appropriate for English and writing programs in the 21st century.</li>
    <li>Portfolio instruction will be shared across the entire program, not located in one or two classes or dependent on one or two instructors.</li>
    <li>Individual instructors will be able to grab pieces for course assessment on an individual basis.</li>
    <li>Once portfolios are built, students would already have a system in place if instructors require them to use portfolios to deliver coursework.</li>
    <li>This proposal removes the onus of the department or program having to maintain servers, folder systems, or software. All we would need is a centralized list, easily maintained in a spreadsheet, shared folder, or wiki page. </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Weaknesses of student-maintained e-portfolios</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Records management; we cede control of portfolios and thus cede troubleshooting if students lose passwords, crash or delete their portfolio, etcetera. We leave part of our program at the mercy of outside systems.</li>
    <li>If portfolios are distributed rather than centralized, so is portfolio management. Who ensures that students and instructors are contributing? Do we create more work for program administrators with this system?</li>
    <li>Transfer students or major/minor changes; what do we do with students who enter the program mid-degree? If portfolio is about outcomes and required elements, not necessarily a specified copia, this shouldn’t be an issue, but may still be a consideration.</li>
    <li>Other proposals have suggested using Blackboard, where students already ‘are.’ This proposal introduces yet another element to their academic media ecology.</li>
    <li>Technological proficiency of students, especially early in the program. Students may not want to get into online publishing of this type.</li>
    <li>Students may not want to have an online portfolio.</li>
	  <li>Privacy concerns and contributions to digital detritus.</li>
  </ul>
