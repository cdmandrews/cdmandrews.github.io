<p><strong><font size="+2">Writing Workshops</font></strong></p>
<p>As stated on the syllabus, much of the course will be conducted in workshop 
  format. That means that nearly every class period you must bring your work and 
  be prepared to: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Write for a minimum of 20-30 minutes most class periods</li>
  <li>Participate actively in exercises meant to help improve/advance your work</li>
  <li> Share your work and ask questions/express concerns about it</li>
  <li> Consider the comments of others on your work as you revise</li>
  <li> Evaluate the work of others honestly, with constructive criticism</li>
  <li> Work productively on assignments as class time is given </li>
</ul>
<p>Consistent problems in any of these areas may result in reductions of your 
  workshop grade. Failure to bring work (especially assigned drafts) to class 
  will mean significant reductions of your workshop grade. </p>
<p><strong>Steady Writing Sessions<br>
  </strong>Note that the first item is to write for a minimum of 20-30 minutes 
  most class periods. The two most important aspects of a writing workshop are 
  1) the opportunity for collaboration and feedback; and 2) the opportunity to 
  write. One of the goals of the semester is to help you develop better, more 
  consistent writing habits. Despite many student protestations to the contrary, 
  very few writers actually write better in last-minute binges or in huge chunks 
  of time. Thus, this term we are going to practice <em>nihil nimus</em> in our 
  writing--nothing in excess, all things in moderation. Including writing. But 
  moderation requires steadiness, doing it regularly and habitually.</p>
<p>Therefore, to help you develop the habit of steady writing, you will be required 
  to spend 20-30 minutes (usually the last 20-30 minutes of class) each class 
  period writing on something related to your course project. No whining, no excuses, 
  no internet surfing (whether relevant or not), no researching, no going elsewhere 
  to do it, no working on other projects. You will just, plain and simple, write, 
  whether you feel like you have anything to say or not. Then, at least twice 
  more during the week, you will be required to write for 20-30 minutes each, 
  for a total of three steady writing sessions. This is in addition to other work 
  you are doing for the course; the steady writing must focus directly on your 
  writing project. At the beginning of certain class periods, I will ask for a 
  progress report on your steady writing, either as a brief note or in a class 
  discussion. Bring the writings with you as well. Although you do not have to 
  turn them in to the instructor, we may look at them as part of the workshop.</p>
<p>Although I'm only requiring three sessions per week, it would probably be most 
  helpful to have a session everyday. You might use the other 2-4 sessions to 
  help you stay steady on other class projects. With each session, if you really 
  get going, you may, of course, write for much longer than 30 minutes. But the 
  key is to get started, do a little bit everyday, and see the progress.</p>
