## Project Proposal
Audience: The class, the instructor

### Purpose:
To do preliminary planning for your writing project and receive feedback during early stages; to practice communicating your ideas clearly to a professional audience.

### Assignment:
Write a proposal communicating your ideas about your project and your general knowledge about writing in your field to the instructor and the rest of the class. The proposal should also be somewhat persuasive in nature; you must convince us that this is indeed a worthwhile project within your field and within the parameters of this class. Remember that this class has members from multiple fields--write so that any graduate student could understand the basics of your proposal.

### Elements of the Proposal:
Address the following in your proposal
- Provide an overview of the project: what is the topic, what research question are you exploring, what is the scope of your project. If applicable, discuss any work that you have already completed on this project.
- Discuss the importance of this topic in your field. What need/gap will this project address? What larger conversation within the field will you be joining?
- Identify the academic/professional genre that your project will be written in. Discuss why you have chosen this particular genre. Also discuss audience--who will read your project beyond the parameters of this class?
- Discuss what is considered "good writing" in this field and for this genre--what are the expectations? You don't need to talk about general "good writing" issues, such as grammar, organization, etc. (these are assumed). What expectations are specific to your field?
- State what documentation style is expected (APA, MLA, IEEE, Turabian, etc.) in your field. Identify a resource that will help you with writing and documentation in this field. (Note: this means a reference book about writing, not a source that is about your specific topic).
- List, using the documentation style above, three scholarly sources related to your writing project topic.

### Grading:
The grade for the proposals is an all-or-nothing grade; you either get 100% or a 0. However, you will have multiple opportunities to get that 100%. I will meet with each student individually about the proposal, and after our discussion, you may be asked to rewrite some or all of it to earn that 100%. The point of this assignment is to make sure your project is feasible, is professional-oriented, and has a clear purpose from the beginning.

## Mini Literature Review (Article Synthesis)
Audience: Fellow professionals

### Purpose:
To identify important professional conversations related to your writing project.

One of the most important scholarly genres in any field is the literature review. Usually, these reviews don't stand alone; they are part of larger projects, such as a thesis/dissertation or a scholarly article. The lit review demonstrates that you understand the background of the topic you are addressing, that you have researched what others have said about the issue before you dive in with your own perspective. The literature review helps to establish your credibility to talk about this issue and connects you to the scholarship of your field. It shows your views are part of an ongoing conversation among fellow professionals. It's a way to help set up your own point.

Literature reviews are usually rather extensive, and many of you may be doing one as part of (or the whole of) your writing project. But everybody needs practice in identifying the professional conversation, articulating it to an audience, and stating how you connect to it. Thus we have this assignment, which is a literature review in miniature.

### Assignment:
Find three journal articles related to your writing project that take different positions on or approaches to a relatively similar topic. Write a 5-7 page essay in which you identify the central issue under discussion, discuss how each of the three articles addresses this issue, and then provide your own take on this conversation (what is your stance?). Be sure you don't simply summarize each article. You must put them in conversation--show how they relate to each other and to the issue at hand.

You may cite other sources if it will help, but keep the paper focused mostly on these three.

## Annotated Bibliography

Audience: You

### Purpose
To gather information about sources that you may use in your writing project.

### Assignment
Create an annotated bibliography of at least 25 sources related to your writing project. This is to be a working bibliography. That means it is a research tool, not an absolute list of sources that you must then cite in your final project. Some may be sources that you referred to and then did not use, or they may be background information that you need for other purposes.

Keep in mind that you can use a myriad of sources. Of course journals and books are resources that you will need to include, but many online sites are excellent resources. Things such as listservs and other more interactive type sources may be acceptable as well. Do not, however, turn in a bibliography with only such sources. Make sure most of your sources have some form of scholarly credibility.

Each source listing should begin with a properly formatted bibliographic entry, followed by an annotation that briefly summarizes the source, then discusses its quality and/or potential usefulness. If you use any non-scholarly sources (such as a commercial website), it will be especially important to demonstrate the site's credibility and usefulness in relation to your project. Note from the examples that you may be very brief in your annotations - you don't necessarily even have to use complete sentences, as long as it makes sense.

Use the documentation style that you have identified as most appropriate for your field (APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE, etc.)

### Sample Entries (using MLA style):

Belch, Holley A., ed. Serving Students with Disabilities. New Directions for Student Services 91. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Pub., 2000.

A compilation of articles for Student Service departments in the university. Articles on many topics ranging from legal issues and funding, to recruitment and accommodations. Written by practitioners and program directors, the articles are based on studies and research. Valuable resource for institutions. Other editions coming.

Brueggemann, Brenda Jo, Linda Feldmeier White, Patricia A. Dunn, Barbara A. Heifferon, and Johnson Cheu. "Becoming Visible: Lessons in Disability." College Composition and Communication 52 (2001): 368-398.

Invaluable source! Five expert authors show passion with a well-organized, informative, educational article on LD and composition. Discussion of the "invisibility" of LD, social constructions of LD (with which I find some fault), rhetoric of unacceptance of LD in "normal classroom," texts and classrooms in which making visible LD changes the methods and results. The authors call for a shake-up of routine methods of teaching composition that neglects acknowledgment of LD. Challenges educators to recognize LD while at the same time offering suggestions to that end. Invoked so much passion and interest in me.


## Conference Proposal

## Writing Project
Audience: Professionals in your field

### Purpose
To develop an extended project related to your field of study that will contribute to your academic or professional career.

### Assignment
Early in the semester, identify an issue/need/gap within your field of study or your profession that you can address through writing. Then develop a writing project that will address this need and take the form of a recognized academic or professional genre. Most of the work you do in this class will relate directly to this project.

The following are some suggestions for Writing Project formats:

- Conference Paper
- Thesis/Dissertation (or chapter of)
- Literature Review
- Journal Article
- Quantitative/Qualitative Report
- Annual Report
- Grant Proposal
- Textbook Chapter
- Training Documents

A typical class research paper is NOT an acceptable genre for this assignment. You are not simply showing your knowledge of the field; you are entering a conversation and contributing to the knowledge of the field. The genre you choose must have a professional context, not just be an academic exercise. Do not use a term paper from another class unless you are substantially revising it into a professional document.

Throughout the semester, you will work on your Writing Projects individually and in groups. Final projects will not be considered for a grade unless you have worked on them throughout the semester during the Writing Workshop activities. In other words, if you work on a project throughout the semester and then decide the last week of class to turn in a completely different project, the work will not be accepted. The emphasis in this class is on the process of putting together a project, not just turning in a final document for a grade. A project proposal is due early in the semester. You may not significantly change your topic once this proposal has been approved.

## Writing Workshops

As stated on the syllabus, much of the course will be conducted in workshop format. That means that nearly every class period you must bring your work and be prepared to:

- Write for a minimum of 20-30 minutes most class periods
- Participate actively in exercises meant to help improve/advance your work
- Share your work and ask questions/express concerns about it
- Consider the comments of others on your work as you revise
- Evaluate the work of others honestly, with constructive criticism
- Work productively on assignments as class time is given

Consistent problems in any of these areas may result in reductions of your workshop grade. Failure to bring work (especially assigned drafts) to class will mean significant reductions of your workshop grade.

### Steady Writing Sessions
Note that the first item is to write for a minimum of 20-30 minutes most class periods. The two most important aspects of a writing workshop are 1) the opportunity for collaboration and feedback; and 2) the opportunity to write. One of the goals of the semester is to help you develop better, more consistent writing habits. Despite many student protestations to the contrary, very few writers actually write better in last-minute binges or in huge chunks of time. Thus, this term we are going to practice nihil nimus in our writing--nothing in excess, all things in moderation. Including writing. But moderation requires steadiness, doing it regularly and habitually.

Therefore, to help you develop the habit of steady writing, you will be required to spend 20-30 minutes (usually the last 20-30 minutes of class) each class period writing on something related to your course project. No whining, no excuses, no internet surfing (whether relevant or not), no researching, no going elsewhere to do it, no working on other projects. You will just, plain and simple, write, whether you feel like you have anything to say or not. Then, at least twice more during the week, you will be required to write for 20-30 minutes each, for a total of three steady writing sessions. This is in addition to other work you are doing for the course; the steady writing must focus directly on your writing project. At the beginning of certain class periods, I will ask for a progress report on your steady writing, either as a brief note or in a class discussion. Bring the writings with you as well. Although you do not have to turn them in to the instructor, we may look at them as part of the workshop.

Although I'm only requiring three sessions per week, it would probably be most helpful to have a session everyday. You might use the other 2-4 sessions to help you stay steady on other class projects. With each session, if you really get going, you may, of course, write for much longer than 30 minutes. But the key is to get started, do a little bit everyday, and see the progress.
