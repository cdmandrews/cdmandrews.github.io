<p><strong><font size="+2">Project Proposal</font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> The class, the instructor</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> <br>
  To do preliminary planning for your writing project and receive feedback during 
  early stages; to practice communicating your ideas clearly to a professional 
  audience.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> <br>
  Write a proposal communicating your ideas about your project and your general 
  knowledge about writing in your field to the instructor and the rest of the 
  class. The proposal should also be somewhat persuasive in nature; you must convince 
  us that this is indeed a worthwhile project within your field and within the 
  parameters of this class. Remember that this class has members from multiple 
  fields--write so that any graduate student could understand the basics of your 
  proposal. </p>
<p><strong>Elements of the Proposal:<br>
  </strong>Address the following in your proposal</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide an overview of the project: what is the topic, what research question 
    are you exploring, what is the scope of your project. If applicable, discuss 
    any work that you have already completed on this project.</li>
  <li>Discuss the importance of this topic in your field. What need/gap will this 
    project address? What larger conversation within the field will you be joining?</li>
  <li>Identify the academic/professional genre that your project will be written 
    in. Discuss why you have chosen this particular genre. Also discuss audience--who 
    will read your project beyond the parameters of this class?</li>
  <li>Discuss what is considered &quot;good writing&quot; in this field and for 
    this genre--what are the expectations? You don't need to talk about general 
    &quot;good writing&quot; issues, such as grammar, organization, etc. (these 
    are assumed). What expectations are specific to your field? </li>
  <li>State what documentation style is expected (APA, MLA, IEEE, Turabian, etc.) 
    in your field. Identify a resource that will help you with writing and documentation 
    in this field. (Note: this means a reference book about writing, not a source 
    that is about your specific topic).</li>
  <li>List, using the documentation style above, three scholarly sources related 
    to your writing project topic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grading:<br>
  </strong>The grade for the proposals is an all-or-nothing grade; you either 
  get 100% or a 0. However, you will have multiple opportunities to get that 100%. 
  I will meet with each student individually about the proposal, and after our 
  discussion, you may be asked to rewrite some or all of it to earn that 100%. 
  The point of this assignment is to make sure your project is feasible, is professional-oriented, 
  and has a clear purpose from the beginning.</p>
