## About 4320
ENGL 4320 is "Professional writing workshop" and varies by topic. This is a common starting place for new courses, where we can try them out before adding to the catalog. Largely geared towards:
- jr/sr Technical & Professional Writing minors (who come from communication, graphic design & journalism programs, and a variety of social and natural sciences) or Comm/Graphic Design majors who take them as upper-level electives.
- jr/sr English majors, mostly Writing Studies track, some Lit Studies track

## About THIS Course
This course explores social media from the perspective of technical and professional writing: both how companies, organizations, and professionals adapt social media to their own ends and how user-generated content has changed the meaning and activities of technical and professional writers more generally.

We will study knowledge work, ethics of networked identities and organizations, and how social media complicate traditional models of audience, delivery, and the rhetorical situation. Weâ€™ll learn about content strategy and research how organizations adopt social media to their purposes and contexts. Most importantly, we will practice strategies for developing focused, accessible, rhetorical, and afterlife-conscious web content.

## Course Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Apply rhetorical skills relevant to digital composing and social media, including:
 - Planning, composing, and revising accessible, rhetorical content
 - Repurposing content for different delivery media
 - Working with governance and content strategy
- Explain ethical, social, and technological issues relevant to professional and personal uses of social media
- Evaluate distinctive social media practices in professions, organizations, or communities relevant to their academic interests or career field

### Week-to-week docs
Spring 2020. We shut down halfway through and went online for the pandemic, so the second half of the semester was a weird transition with some really great outcomes.

Big shift relevant to this page: change to  from slideshows (weeks 1-8) to docs (weeks 9-15) for delivery. Was also mediated with short, nonrequired, 1/weekly Slack sessions to talk about work that was due/upcoming and discuss that week's topics.

### Projects

[This slideshow is the template/instructions for the final project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z5q2tsDIaINHdNOb7CTLFgUVzmO3Q3JyOctlGWIj6jU/edit?usp=sharing), which asked students to examine six principles from the World Health Organization (WHO) communication strategy, analyzing and evaluating how WHO applied it on their social media streams. They also selected a Coastal Bend local or regional nonprofit organization and evaluated that org's social media, providing kudos or recommendations. Students then were to connect their analysis back to key course concepts (rhetorical situation, ecology, velocity, publics) as well as forecast what they might take with them from the assignment in future work or personal social media use. Instructions and commentary included in the slideshow template.
