<h1>Attention and Style</h1>
<p>In the preface to <em>The Economics of Attention</em>, Richard Lanham moved rapidly from "What's next for text," to a much broader one "What's new about the new economy?" The connection is important. In these notes, I'll comment on his ideas about attention and <em>oscillatio</em>, ending with some notes on style, which may well be the basic problem we will deal with this semester.</p>
<h2>1. What's next for text?</h2>
<p>Lanham took up "What's next for text" in his earlier and often hyperbolic book, <em>The Electronic Word</em> (1995). Still talking about hypertext CD-ROMs and the earliest iterations of hypertext on Internet, he argued that electronic text does the following (1995, pp. x-xiii):</p>
<ul>
<li>Redefines what a text is</li>
<li>Has "essential typographical plasticity"</li>
<li>Is "volatile and interactive"</li>
<li>Is manipulable, convertible</li>
<li>Is a deeply rhetorical medium (as opposed to the philosophic medium of print)</li>
<li>Creates a new writing space and a new education space</li>
<li>Puts "the major questions of our current intellectual agenda into a new relationship and sheds new light on them"</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll come back to some of these later in the semester, when we read an excerpt from that book, but the essential thesis is that electronic text has thrown the Western intellectual tradition's previous conceptions about the nature and morality of the printed word up into the air. A lot of this has to do with a move from reading in the staid, calm realm of the codex book, with its wide margins and seeming transparency, into reading on the Web, where words and images glitter and move. This is a shift that started earlier in the twentieth century under the influence of newspaper, print advertising, and TV/radio, but has only intensified as we've begun doing everything via screens and the social web.</p>
<h2>2. Attention is everything</h2>
<p>"The devices that regulate attention are stylistic devices" (Lanham, 2006, p. xi). With this claim in <em>The Economics of Attention</em>, Richard Lanham relocated arts and letters (not the humanities, where some would put literature and rhetoric, or the social sciences, where some would locate technical communication and professional writing), at the center of the universe, displacing the physical sciences and engineering.</p>
<p>Lanham has what I consider to be the sexiest of definitions of <strong>rhetoric: The economics of attention, the discipline "that tells us how to allocate our central scarce resource, to invite people attend to what we would like them to attend to" </strong>(p. xii). Aristotle talked about rhetoric as "the art of persuasion," by which he meant persuading people to change their mind or will through speech, in particular by understanding how audiences think so as to best invent, structure, and decorate one's argument such that it is successful. If you've ever taken a speech class in your life, you should basically understand the Aristotelian program. And while rhetoric in its oldest forms may not help us talk very well about the design of objects (or, in the case of this class, of web sites and online conversations), it's a fine starting place. As Lanham wrote later, the disciplines that "create attention structures to teach us how to attend to the world" are vital, not just for critique or reflection, but for action. That is, rhetoric offers us a heuristic for critique (understanding how and why the world works) as well as a program for action (getting out there and producing the work).</p>
<h2>3. Attention oscillates</h2>
<p>Seeking a rhetorical figure for the age, Lanham coined oscillatio, the "fundamental rhythm of attention" (p. xiii). Humans can both concentrate and reflect, but not at the same time. We oscillate between looking AT and looking THROUGH (endnote 1), alternately participating in and reflecting on, writing and revising, acting and being self-aware, constantly going back and forth from one to the other. (Some of us more than others...) When you watch a movie, are you aware of the lighting, framing, pacing, editing and camerawork as such, or are you just along for the ride and enjoying the story? Neither way is superior&mdash;we oscillate between the two, sometimes we go on our own as our attention wanders, or other times we are jerked out of THROUGH and reminded of AT. Say, when your favorite show makes a sudden and unforgivable continuity error or an actor does something completely out of character&mdash;you are suddenly reminded to be self-conscious, that yes, after all, this is a movie, a creation, a mediated experience. Before the error, you were fully in the moment, looking THROUGH the medium to the story or experience, but when it happens, you are yanked out to see AT it. That nasty spelling error in your resume? It makes the reader look AT the surface of the text when she just wants to speedily look THROUGH to the content.</p>
<p>This is not at all to say that one is better than the other. Sometimes we need to be reminded of AT, that the experience is mediated and stylized, and understand the role that style and medium play in messages. Other times, it's THROUGH that's more important, and texts are designed in such a way to encourage the medium to seem to disappear.</p>
<p>Here. Let's let Lanham say it in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>I argue that there are two ways to look at a text: AT it, that is to say accepting its style, its verbal surface, as its way to make meaning; and THROUGH it, that is to say looking for a "content" beneath the verbal surface and independent of it. We usually think of communication as a THROUGH affair; cut to the chase, get to the substance. But in an attention economy, the substance is the style. In such an economy, AT vision is as important as THROUGH vision. The essential skill, as much for an economist as for a cultural critic, is to know how to toggle from one to the other as circumstances dictate. I argue ... that this skill in toggling has stood at the center of rhetorical training since the Greeks invented formal rhetoric. So, "what should text be?" It is going to be, as it has always been, a combination of style and substance; the trick in an attention economy is to see that style and substance, and our expectations for them, have changed places.</blockquote>
<p>Style and medium aren't secondary, they're not the extra layer or the sugar-coated topping. Style is primary. It's the message. (go read Marshall McLuhan). Okay, it's not THE message, but it's a huge (endnote 2) part of the message, and we can't so easily dichotomize style and content (endnote 3). For good or ill, and often both, style is the substance that wins hearts and minds these days.</p>
<h2>4. Design is about managing attention</h2>
<p>"&lsquo;Design' is our name for the interface where stuff meets fluff. The design of an artifact invites us to attend to it in a particular way, to pay a certain type of attention to it. Design tells us not about stuff per se but what we think about stuff." (Lanham 2006, p. 18). Why do heavy metal bands have certain kinds of logos? What site design elements do sculptors and painters tend to use for their web galleries? This is the simple truth of red notifications on a blue background. We'll talk extensively about design this semester&mdash;I'd like to begin by considering design from the viewpoint of style.</p>
<p>In <em>Writing for the Web</em>, one of Lynda Felder's opening dicta for writing style is "Make your content clear." Her short heuristic:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the purpose of your content? <strong>If you don't know</strong>, your content probably won't be clear.</li>
<li>What are the key messages that you want your readers to take away? <strong>If you don't know</strong>, your content probably won't be clear.</li>
<li>Who is the content written for? <strong>If you don't know</strong>&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>What is clarity? It's like transparency&mdash;it's un-self-conscious. It's see-thru. You don't look AT the window, you look THROUGH the window (unless it's a dirty window with a crud-covered screen). Clarity would almost seem to be the anti-style. But of course it is not; clarity is a matter of style. After all: how do we get Lynda Felder's message here? Through style, through a certain self-consciousness in her writing that leads us to a particular perspective. In this case, through repetition. I've highlighted part of it, adding an extra layer of attention in our little economy. Ironically, she defines clarity negatively: "if you don't know, it's not clear." I don't know about you, but I don't find that definition especially clear.</p>
<p>I wouldn't suggest that "clarity" is a bad goal, but what is clarity? Who decides? How do we know? This is a matter that Lanham took up more extensively in some of his texts on sentence style in particular. In<em> Analyzing Prose,</em> Lanham (2003) claimed clarity's status as one of the primary virtues of writing is problematic: "We will agree on 'clarity' only to the extent that we live in the same time, place, and world of values (p. 190). Consider Platonic notions about ideas, reality, and words. For Plato (see especially his dialogue <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/gorgias.html">Gorgias</a>), ideas were concrete, knowable, and perfect, and not social constructs as we tend to think of them today. Words (in particular stylized or rhetorical language) were a value-laden filter, getting in the way of a 1:1 correspondence between idea and reality. Try to define justice, love, truth. Even worse, try to explain your motives for doing something. Your definition would likely not be the same as the next person's, and competing definitions are at the heart of our communication problems today.</p>
<p>The best style, for the early Greek philosophers, should be basically invisible. For Plato and Aristotle especially, this was a moral choice, because "Ideas seem to depend on the words that express them" (Lanham, 2003, p. 205). Skilled writers can create realities, and as we all know well today, if a writer can manipulate words, she can "fake what we want to think an unfakeable code, He can fabricate an alternative reality" (p. 207). Style cannot be invisible or transparent because ultimately, it's a matter of words. And in texts, which are materially-mediated, it's a matter of words and space and color and layout and design and images and social/historical attitudes towards writing and all of the other raw material of our media.</p>
<p><strong>This, ultimately, is why Lynda Felder&mdash;and Janice Redish (author of our textbook) have students learning web writing begin with conversations and people. As Lanham argued: "the reality we are being 'clear' about dwells within us as well as 'out there.' The 'successful communication' that 'clarity' points to is finally our success in getting someone else to share our view of the world, a view we have composed by perceiving it" (2003, p. 3).</strong></p>
