<h1>Writing for the Web, Spring 2017</h1>
<p>All information on this page about the course schedule should not be considered final until the end of the first full week of classes, as I (and you) update and change outdated or incorrect information. Even after that point, our schedule and assignments should be considered a hard "tentative" and are subject to some change. I will discuss all such changes with you, and will provide said changes in writing.</p>

<li>apply approaches from rhetoric and user experience to develop accessible and ethical web content,</li>
<li>learn to accommodate the needs of online readers through writing style, structure, and web design,</li>
<li>design and/or redesign web projects for clients and audiences using basic software tools, templates, and languages such as HTML5 and CSS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Catalog description</strong>:Writing for the Web emphasizes practical concepts related to writing and communication on the internet and the World Wide Web. Attention is given to finding and analyzing information; analyzing and designing WWW sites and other digital, hypertextual environments; and analyzing and composing hypertext-hypermedia materials for digital, networked environments.

<h2>Course Policies</h2>
<h3>Late work</h3>
<p>Post assignments on time. <strong>I don't accept late work. </strong>The last day to submit work will be posted on this wiki. I do accept revisions on major projects, provided that you meet formally with me to discuss feedback on your project, a revision agenda, and a timeline for completion. See the complete revise and resubmit policy for more information.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>As you might rightly assume, an online course titled "Writing for the Web" is entirely imbricated with technology: the class is about technology, and it works because of, as a result of, and in dialogue with technology. Difficulty with your computer or technology is not an acceptable excuse for late work, whether those are reading responses or one of our major projects.</p>
<p>While I do not expect you to be come an expert in HTML/CSS in fifteen weeks, for example, I do expect you to push beyond your current technical knowledge. Ultimately, you are responsible for your command of technology as well as course content. I will help you do this and provide resources to support you, but if you are having difficulty it is your responsibility toa) ask for help and b) look for tutorials and supplementary material that work for you (this is but one small example of an important idea, a "rhetoric of personal agency," which we'll talk about during the term).</p>
<p>A spirit of inquiry and experiment is just as important as particular technical skills in this course. "Showing up" with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing up with an excuse, and sometimes we can learn more from your broken website than some slick Squarespace module. Your honest effort is more interesting to me than perfect work. (Just make sure that your efforts are sustained rather than saved for the night before something is due...)</p>
<p>I encourage visits during my office hours or other times we arrange, or we can meet virtually using Slack. Please contact me via email or our Slack channel well in advance of assignment deadlines</p>
<h3>Social accounts and privacy</h3>
<p>I have asked you to sign up for GitHub, PBworks, and other social accounts for this class. These are public accounts, and thus searchable and potentially scalable: you can't control who finds what, how, and where.<strong>To protect your privacy you may create a pseudonym or alias for GitHub and any other account.</strong> At the same time, I strongly encourage you to consider the long-term value of establishing these accounts under your own name or a professional alias. Having accounts where you conduct yourself professionally might well be an asset to your online presence, proving to be useful elements of portfolios you might eventually rely on when applying for jobs or schools in the future.</p>
<h3>Interacting</h3>
<h4>In this class, interacting is attending.</h4>
<p>Interacting with your classmates is just as valuable as interacting with the instructor. See the "Interacting in this Course" document for more details, but in general:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Class discussions on Slack and this wiki are an important learning tool in the course. Take advantage them. Add your opinions to/participate in the discussions, but do so respectfully.</li>
  <li>Work extra hard to get to know other classmates. Reach out through email or our Slack channel to support each other. If you have good info/tips on what is working for you, on resources, or other ideas, please share with the group so we can help each other out.</li>
  <li>Use the "Troubleshooting" Slack channel to ask technical or process questions. The class will become its own community of practice, and you will be amazed at how good of a resource your colleagues can be.</li>
  <li>Don't use forums other than your Islander email account to ask or talk about grades. Grade discussions are private and should occur with your instructor only.</li>
</ul>
<h4>You are responsible for you.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check the assignments every week. Don't wait until the last minute.</li>
  <li>Don't get behind. This is not a "work at your own pace" course and cannot be completed in two weeks at the end of the term. If you get behind in an online course it is harder to get back on track than it is in a traditional course.</li>
  <li>Keep up with your assignments and your grades. It is not the teacher's responsibility to tell you what you have or haven't turned in. Grades will be available in Blackboard so all you have to do is regularly check to make sure you have grades posted for all work.</li>
  <li>Check your email. I will email announcements and information to your University email account. You may set up email forwarding if you wish, but you are responsible for checking email. Missing emails is not an excuse for missed work or announcements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other policies</h2>
<h3>Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty:</h3>
<p>University students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty. Academic misconduct for which a student is subject to penalty includes all forms of cheating, such as illicit possession of examinations or examination materials, falsification, forgery, complicity or plagiarism. (Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another as one's own work.) In this class, academic misconduct or complicity in an act of academic misconduct on an assignment or test will result in: first offense, no credit for assignment; subsequent offenses, failure of class.</p>
<p>In general terms, students are expected to "demonstrate a high level of maturity, self-direction and ability to manage their own affairs" and to "conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty." Instances of plagiarism will be handled in accordance with Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi General Academic Policies and Regulations as listed in the current catalog.</p>
<h3>Notice to Students with Disabilities:</h3>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please call or visit Disability Services at (361) 825-5816 in Corpus Christi Hall 116. If you are a returning veteran and are experiencing cognitive and/or physical access issues in the classroom, or on campus, please contact the Disability Services office for assistance.</p>
<h3>Reminder to English Majors:</h3>
<p>As part of the English undergraduate capstone course (ENGL 4351), all English majors are required to submit a portfolio of writings in different discourse genres that they have completed for their college classes. To help you prepare for this assignment, you should keep a copy of all essays, research papers, literary analyses, creative and report writing, etc., so that you will have an ample selection from which to choose when the portfolio comes due.</p>
<h3>Academic Advising:</h3>
<p>Please check with your Academic Advisor with any questions about your degree plan.</p>
<h3>Grade Appeal Process:</h3>
<p>As stated in University Rule 13.02.99.C2, Student Grade Appeals, a student who believes that he or she has not been held to appropriate academic standards as outlined in the class syllabus, equitable evaluation procedures, or appropriate grading, may appeal the final grade given in the course. The burden of proof is upon the student to demonstrate the appropriateness of the appeal. A student with a complaint about a grade is encouraged to first discuss the matter with the instructor. For complete details, including the responsibilities of the parties involved in the process and the number of days allowed for completing the steps in the process, see University Rule13.02.99.C2, Student Grade Appeals, and University Procedure 13.02.99.C2.01, Student Grade Appeal Procedures. These documents are accessible through the University Rules Web site a<a href="http://www.tamucc.edu/provost/university_rules/index.html">http://www.tamucc.edu/provost/university_rules/index.html</a>. For assistance and/or guidance in the grade appeal process, students may contact the Office of Student Affairs.</p>
<h3>Statement of Academic Continuity:</h3>
<p>In the event of an unforeseen adverse event, such as a major hurricane and classes could not be held on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University&ndash;Corpus Christi; this course would continue through the use of Blackboard and/or email. In addition, the syllabus and class activities may be modified to allow continuation of the course. Ideally, University facilities (i.e., emails, web sites, and Blackboard) will be operational within two days of the closing of the physical campus. However, students need to make certain that the course instructor has a primary and a secondary means of contacting each student.</p>
