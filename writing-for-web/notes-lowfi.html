<p>There are lots of weird and fun tools in the corners of the web for creating wireframes and site plans, but the best tools are ones you already own: <strong>Get some PAPER and a PENCIL (or a pen (a box of crayons will work for goodness' sake)) and just start drawing</strong>. Skip the bugs and the high-tech solutions, get <strong>low-fi</strong>, and literally sketch out what you want your site to do.</p>
<p>Remember to start with visitors: What will they do? What will they ask? What's their end of the conversation?</p>
<p>Why is low-fi paper prototyping the way to go early on?</p>
<ol>
  <li>It's <strong>fast</strong>. Just pick up the pencil and start sketching. See results immediately.</li>
  <li>It's <strong>simple</strong>. You don't need to spend time looking up code or learning a new interface.</li>
  <li>It's easy to get your design i<strong>n front of a user's eyeballs</strong>.</li>
  <li>Users can use a pencil just as easily as you can; and you should <strong>let them </strong>make changes!</li>
  <li>It's <strong>easier to iterate</strong> (revise to the next version) if you haven't spent laborious hours entering everything into Wordpress or Google Sites or some wireframing tool. Make changes on the go.</li>
  <li>It's <strong>easier to be critical</strong> when everything is unpolished.</li>
</ol>
<p>Marc Rettig's article "<a href="https://bb9.tamucc.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-176202-dt-announcement-rid-25009282_1/xid-25009282_1">Prototyping for Tiny Fingers</a>" provides a thorough rationale and overview for paper prototyping, and is well worth the time spent reading. It's written for a design/business audience, not an academic one, so the article is pretty easy to sink your teeth into. (Log in to Blackboard to download the .pdf)</p>
<p>Remember that the more you set down to writing early on, the better. Writing is generative--you'll come up with ideas and have aha! moments as you go. Or you'll come to fuller realizations about the problems that are in front of you. Either way, don't undercut yourself on your weekly post. Write freely and generatively, try out ideas, and post pictures (they don't have to be any good) of what you're wanting to do. The more work you do now, the easier it'll come later!</p>
