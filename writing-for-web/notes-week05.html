<h1>The ethics of a nibble: Why it's tough to be concise online and still remain a good person</h1>
<p><strong>Write headlines with messages and concise summaries to help your visitors find the information they need for their situation, but write ethically. Today&rsquo;s readers are hungry for content as ever, but are becoming increasingly leery of clickbait and fake news.</strong></p>
<p>I consider myself handy (if not always especially careful) with woodworking tools, so one website I frequent is <em>Make</em>. The article &ldquo;<a href="http://makezine.com/2017/02/12/5-essential-shop-tools-can-make/">5 Indispensable Shop Tools You Can Make Yourself</a>&rdquo; may not be the greatest piece of web writing ever committed to HTML, but it is a good example of Bite, Snack, Meal in action.</p>
<p>As you read about in Chapter 7 of <em>Letting Go of the Words</em>, Bite, Snack, Meal is a now-classic approach to writing web content involving three elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bite: a headline with a message</li>
<li>Snack: a concise summary of the content</li>
<li>Meal: the content</li>
</ol>
<h2>Bite: A headline with a message</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s backwards-engineer this. The headline could be considerably less clear: &ldquo;Make Your Own Tools,&rdquo; &ldquo;Work-a-day Shop Tools,&rdquo; or &ldquo;5 Shop Tools in a Video&rdquo; are <em>correct</em>, but they do not get the full, essential message of the article across. A list of the five tools wouldn&rsquo;t work either: &ldquo;Instructions to build a 5-in-1 Revolving Workstation, Drawer-Mounted Table Saw, Homemade Moxon Vise, Shop Vac Cyclone, and Machine Flip Table&rdquo; is ridiculously specific. Breaking their original title down:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>5</strong>: Most style guides, from AP to Chicago, encourage writers not to put numerals in headlines, and never at the beginning of a sentence. But because <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy#sm.0002ltsng18czd6cu1a1q95spephc">our brains are more likely to pay attention to visuals</a>, quickly-scannable Arabic numerals are easy on readers. <a href="https://bakermarketingservices.com/2013/03/3-powerful-reasons-for-using-odd-numbered-lists-in-your-blog-post-titles/">Research has consistently shown</a> that putting numbers (especially odd numbers) at the front of your headline <em>will</em> get more readers. <strong>Warning</strong>: Readers are aware this is a strategy, don&rsquo;t like to be fooled by it, and are especially sensitive to it since the 2016 election &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Indispensable shop tools</strong>: Note the emotion. Pathos is, for good or ill, the coin of the realm online. If you google &ldquo;writing good headlines&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll find abundant ebullient articles on adjectives in headlines. But the warning applies. Clickbait titles are</li>
<li><strong>You can make yourself</strong>: This is basic Dora-the-Explorer stuff, but it emphasizes the practical nature of the content. It&rsquo;s a simple second-person phrase (we&rsquo;ll talk about writing in the second person elsewhere), but because of it visitors can expect these will be (or should be) instructions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Snack: A concise summary of the content</h2>
<p>The Make article (technically a listicle) is really all snack. The <strong>meal</strong> here is the video, but it&rsquo;s almost six and a half minutes long. ETERNITY. How will I ever decide if I want to waste my time with it? That&rsquo;s where the snack comes in, though once we dig we realize that this listicle involves a hierarchy of bites and snacks.</p>
<p>The article itself is made up of the following: A three-sentence overview summary for the entire video, the embedded video itself, and then five shorter summaries, each between 2 and 4 sentences long, accompanied by screenshots and subheadings.</p>
<p>The opening snack quickly lets me know who and what I might be looking at (Fielding has a channel, which is linked in the text, and I&rsquo;m told he made these builds himself), why it&rsquo;s relevant (these builds will &ldquo;save time, space, and make the work go easier and safer&rdquo;), and what to expect in the article itself (the article will have the video tour and I can read to see each one explained). Importantly, this summary is before and not below the embed. Video content might be king in our high-bandwidth world, but well-written text descriptions will tell me if I actually want to watch that video.</p>
<p>Each of the five shorter summaries quickly calls out what&rsquo;s interesting or relevant about each video. In this case, special features of the build or a short parts list. In <em>Make</em> these short descriptions often emphasize how DIY-friendly projects are. Note that these 2-4 sentence summaries are predominantly active voice and utilize the second-person, with occasional but rare outside links to other sites.</p>
<h2>Just the facts, ma&rsquo;am</h2>
<p>As you&rsquo;ve been discussing in the forums, web visitors are hungry. They <em>want</em> good content. But they&rsquo;re also in a hurry; they might be busy or lazy or casual or even in the middle of an emergency, but regardless of what their state is, we know as a result of research and tons of experience that most people skim swiftly online and don&rsquo;t slow down until they get to what they want. And even then, different people want different things. Bite, Snack, Meal is part of getting the right content (yours) to the right people (your visitors/audience/personas)</p>
<p>Any three-part scheme looks simple, but Bite, Snack, Meal is tricky. Summarizing is a skill to be learned, and there is an ethical angle to summarizing that can&rsquo;t be ignored.</p>
<p>Some of you are likely familiar with the term &ldquo;elevator speech&rdquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got 30 seconds in an elevator to impress the person in the fancy suit with your proposal, your research, or your pitch. What do you tell them? The same principle applies to web content. The trick of summary is gauging your audience and knowing your content such that you can get the right details to the top in just the right length. And such that you don&rsquo;t drawl on and on about details in the wrong situation. If the person in the fancy suit is impressed, they&rsquo;ll continue the conversation with you (whether then or later via email). If not, they&rsquo;ll move on. If your summary is impressive but wrong, on the other hand, you&rsquo;ll later be held to something you said that isn&rsquo;t actually what you meant.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve done much professional and technical writing, you&rsquo;re familiar with beginning documents with either a descriptive or informative summary.</p>
<p><strong>Descriptive</strong>: This overview discusses a scalable approach to content delivery on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Informative</strong>: Write concise summaries and headlines with messages to help your visitors find the information they need for their situation. Use links to connect your headlines and summaries to longer content.</p>
<p>This online textbook does a good job of explaining both. A descriptive summary tells us <em>about</em> the content; often this is like a purpose statement. It tells us <em>what the article does</em>, not <em>what it&rsquo;s about</em>. An informative summary <em>gives us the micro-version</em> of the content. Depending on your situation, Bites and Snacks could be either informative or descriptive; O&rsquo;Flavahan tends towards the descriptive <a href="http://www.ewriteonline.com/bite-snack-and-meal-how-to-feed-content-hungry-site-visitors/">in her examples</a>.</p>
<h2>7 reasons to avoid writing clickbait (#3 will blow your mind)</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen them. Some of you (not me, no never) have even clicked on them. You click, you get three sentences in, and realize that whoever supposedly pwned that other person at that thing really just offered some moderate critique that any reasonable person would say. The thing didn&rsquo;t so much explode as pop moderately loud with a bubble or two. You get mad, you swear never to read that stuff again, and then it&rsquo;s off to the next link.</p>
<p>Clickbait has been a topic in ethics and writing for quite some time, but gained considerable attention in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election in connection with what&rsquo;s become known as &ldquo;fake news.&rdquo; Clickbait and fake news aren&rsquo;t the same thing, but they are related products of an increasingly cutthroat TL;DR attention economy (Buzzfeed dropped <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.yq31Nw2wO#.tsPJeqpqW">some interesting research</a> on <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/fake-news-survey?utm_term=.eq4olByBp#.rhlKxWXWo">fake news last year</a>). And it seems to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/health/15memory.html">affecting our brains</a> and our relationship to information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a problem that can easily be solved. We&rsquo;ve been complaining about information overload since, well, the beginning of information. Plato, Solomon, and Seneca all whined about how many books there were and how horrible it was to have to make them and how they&rsquo;ll suck out our brains if we don&rsquo;t watch out. Every time a new publishing technology arrives on the scene, the bar for access to publishing is lowered and so there is exponentially more information arriving every day. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/01/the-fatal-arrogance-of-tldr.html">Too much noise</a>, and it&rsquo;s all pointed at you!</p>
<p>Ever since Aristotle, our serious institutions have looked down upon on emotional and value-based appeals (those based in pathos rather than logos). But people are emotional creatures, and emotion is the coin of the realm these days. We see it manifested in nonstop Twitter outrage, reaction videos on YouTube, and our beloved petabytes of cat memes.</p>
<p>If we want our content to be read online, we need to be efficient, which means we ought to be concise. At the same time, I believe it&rsquo;s healthy to push back against the cult of efficiency, to read long articles and have long thoughts. The more you do the first, the more often you&rsquo;ll have the second!</p>
