<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>
<p>A-level discussion posts are well above average:</p>
<ul>
<li>answer the prompt in a manner resplendent with individual insights and ideas that connect the words in the text (quoted and paraphrased) to examples the outside world, past experience, or ways of thinking.</li>
<li>The writer attempts to go beyond simply answering the prompt and stimulates further thought and discussion.</li>
<li>The response will be more than a paragraph, logically constructed, and clearly written.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>
<p>B-level discussion posts are above average:</p>
<ul>
<li>answer the prompt, connecting the words in the text (quoted and paraphrased) and providing outside connections or examples,</li>
<li>but do not go much beyond the prompt or add anything new to the discussion.</li>
<li>The response will be more than a paragraph, logically constructed, and clearly written.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>
<p>C-level discussion posts are average:</p>
<ul>
<li>answer all questions asked with obvious information and minimal quotations,</li>
<li>but do not provide outside connections or examples.</li>
<li>The response may be more than a paragraph but lack a depth of knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>
<p>D-level discussion posts are marked more by what they lack rather than what they have, and will be deficient one or more of the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>will not accurately address the prompt,</li>
<li>will fail to provide quotations,</li>
<li>will fail to be a multi-paragraph response,</li>
<li>and/or will be sloppy and hard for readers to understand.</li>
</ul>

<td>Note on responses:</td>
<td>
<p>In your replies to other students' work, you will receive full credit for comments that make a clear, honest effort to engage with the original poster, responding to their writing in a way that goes beyond the obvious.</p>
<p>Simply agreeing or disagreeing with other class members is not sufficient, and will count as failure to reply. Failing to reply to other students' discussion posts will result in a 20% deduction.</p>
