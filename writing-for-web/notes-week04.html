<h1>A Diatribe on and Introduction to Usability</h1>
<p>As we go through the semester, we&rsquo;ll talk more about something called<strong>usability</strong>. As it&rsquo;s defined by Jakob Nielsen (a usability expert I will refer you to a lot this semester),</p>
<p><em>Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word &lsquo;usability&rsquo; also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.(<a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/">Nielsen, &ldquo;Usability 101&rdquo;</a>)</em></p>

<p>Usability testing is a good method for testing everything from staplers to bank ATMs to university websites. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=YM41JHPVX0YEMQRZXKFX">The Design of Everyday Things</a> is perhaps the bible of usability; the author, Don Norman, is one half of the Nielsen/Norman group. His discussion of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY96hTb8WgI">confusing doors</a> will make you want to get up and start usability testing everything. There are Norman Doors ALL OVER FACULTY CENTER, by the way. I hates them.)</p>
<p>Rather than just asking &ldquo;does an interface do what users need?&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s utility, not usability), usability asks how easy is it for users to learn a design, to accomplish basic tasks, and to do so quickly and to their satisfaction. Jakob Nielsen&rsquo;s research is all about how usability is about survival on the web: do users stay, or do they leave? Do they use your site, or do they get lost? Are employees able to use information productively, or do they waste time pondering difficult instructions? In the case of Ginny Redish, are visitors having the conversations they need to have? This idea is the heart of user-centered design. In chapter 2, when Redish instructs you to design goals for your content in terms of &ldquo;What you want your site visitors to do,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s starting with the user at the center. Thus, &ldquo;We want to sell a lot of shoes&rdquo; is very different from &ldquo;We want people to buy shoes from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Building profiles and doing research about who your site visitors are can be quite a bit of work, but having a very concrete visualization of who&rsquo;s going to use your site&mdash;or who&rsquo;s going to read any text you write&mdash;is essential. It WILL make a noticeable difference in how you move through the process. Questions about how to put things or where to put things can be answered when you know something about your visitors, how they use the web, and what their conversational needs are. As Redish (and most technical communication advice) reminds us: experience and expertise, emotions, values, technology, context of use, and demographics are all important variables to consider. They may not all matter, but more than one of them certainly do.</p>
<p>Again, usability is not the same as utility&mdash;whether something is useful. It is also different from &ldquo;quality assurance,&rdquo; &ldquo;preference,&rdquo; &ldquo;functionality,&rdquo; and &ldquo;market research.&rdquo; Usability isn&rsquo;t about whether or not something works; lots of things WORK, but people don&rsquo;t like to use them and so they choose not to. And usability is all about (you guessed it) Users. What they do. What they don&rsquo;t do. What they want to do. Healthcare.gov&rsquo;s launch was famously bad; while much of that had to do with the site&rsquo;s management (or lack thereof; the government had never done something like this before and hired contractors that didn&rsquo;t really understand it either), <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/affordable_care_act_usability_issues/">many of the problems had to do with usability</a>. What were the political ramifications of this failure to user test? The world may never know.</p>
<p>The acronym <strong>MEELS</strong> is how I learned the specific goals of usability testing (if you start reading around in usability, you may see these in a different order, but the five parts are standard). An interface is usable if we&rsquo;ve accounted for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>M</strong>emorability (When a user returns to a site, can they remember where things are, or how to complete a process?)</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>rrors (The user shouldn&rsquo;t make many mistakes when using the product.)</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>fficiency (The user shouldn&rsquo;t have to go through more steps than necessary.)</li>
<li><strong>L</strong>earnability (The easier a system is to learn, the more pleased users will be with it.)</li>
<li><strong>S</strong>atisfaction (People won&rsquo;t do something if they don&rsquo;t like doing it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Usability research questions are answered using a method sometimes called &ldquo;usability testing.&rdquo; Get some representative users, ask them to perform representative tasks, and observe what they do. There are two important rules of thumb for this process: <strong>1) Shut up and let your user talk. 2) You are not your user.</strong></p>
<p>Jakob Nielsen established the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/discount-usability-20-years/">&ldquo;discount usability&rdquo;</a> approach to interface design, a method commonly used in web design and technical communication. Along with discount usability, there are a variety of specific techniques that are used to study usability, including eye-tracking, paper prototyping, retrospective recall, think-aloud protocol, and heuristic evaluation.</p>
<p>Usability is closely related to &ldquo;iterative design,&rdquo; and the two methods are commonly used in tandem. Usability research is different from focus group testing, and is in some ways the opposite of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">&ldquo;waterfall model&rdquo;</a> of design. We won&rsquo;t get very deep into usability testing in this online class, but it&rsquo;s a good way to approach interface design, and we'll talk about iterative design with your major project for the second half of the term..</p>
<p>More on Chapter 3 of Redish&rsquo;s text later; I did want to leave you with one reminder:. Don&rsquo;t ever center text on your webpages. Top-level headings? Okay. Maybe. Text elements? Never. Ever. Never ever ever forever.</p>
