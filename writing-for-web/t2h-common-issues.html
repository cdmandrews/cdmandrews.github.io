<h1>What are some common problems for new(ish) web writers?</h1>
<p>A handful of writing issues can commonly trip up novice web writers, especially if you've internalized academic or college writing styles and formats. Use this checklist as you create new content and revise old content. I've included page or chapter references to Ginny Redish's <em>Letting Go of the Words</em> (2nd edition).</p>
<h2>A quick preface on accesibility</h2>
<p>Accessibility is a critical ethical issue for web designers and publishers today. That being said, this is an introductory course in web writing, and you don't need to freak out about solving obscure technical issues or planning for the intricate mechanics of screen readers. The best things you can do to create accessible websites include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write usable text</strong>: Follow Redish's guidelines for writing usable web content.</li>
<li><strong>Navigability</strong>: Use clear titles and headlines and meaningful link text.</li>
<li><strong>Illustrations</strong>: Don't simply avoid illustrations! Instead, use quality images and write meaningful, descriptive captions or alt text. (<a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/">http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Color</strong>: Consider how you're using color; is the text or image still usable when color is removed? (<a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/images/#color">http://webaim.org/techniques/images/#color</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Run an accesibility test</strong>: enter your site's URL in the WAVE accessibility evaluator and look at your report. (<a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">http://wave.webaim.org/</a>)</li>
<ul>
<li><em>Don't freak out if you find lots of accesibility issues in your report. Some free developer platforms aren't known for their great accesibility. Instead, take the time to reflect on how accessibility and usability considerations complicate the choices web writers have to make.</em></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Place key messages where visitors can see them</h2>
<ul>
<li>On home pages: Identify your site and write a memorable tagline that visitors will see immediately on arriving (75). In Wordpress, this will be your site title and tagline in the "settings" menu.</li>
<li>Use your site visitor's words in main navigational links (86).</li>
<li>Use the Bite, Snack, Meal strategy (134-135) and create headlines, opening paragraphs, and pictures that work together (see especially figure 7-3 on 135)</li>
<li>Remember your inverted pyramid; key messages should be clear and up at the top of pages and paragraphs (136-137).</li>
<li>Break up big walls of words (146-147), but do so within reason for your expository prose. Look at model websites (sites with writing like what you're doing) to gauge paragraph length.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Write headings that preview content for visitors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Headlines (that is, page or article titles) need to entice and direct your readers; don't simply name your topic with a noun (Chapter 8).</li>
<li>In particular, use a statement, question, or call to action (161, and double-check what the empirical research says).</li>
<li>Write usable headings to help visitors scan and overview content (Chapter 9). Usable headings will be questions, statements, and/or verb phrases (170-177)</li>
<li>Use parallelism in your headings (181).</li>
<li>Design to distinguish and clarify your headings (182-184).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Revise for an active, conversational style that visitors will want to read</h2>
<ul>
<li>Yes, you can use "you" (198, 202-205) as well as "I."</li>
<li>USE ACTIVE VOICE (208-211).</li>
<li>Simplify sentences (212-215), but don't feel like you have to go overboard, as you're still writing largely expository and academic topics for the most part.</li>
<li>Keep paragraphs short (218) and remember your inverted pyramid.</li>
<li>If you're listing things or describing a procedure, use lists (Chapter 11).</li>
<li>Make links meaningful (Chapter 12, especially 262-265); avoid phrases like "click here," and think about whether or not embedding (265-266) is appropriate for your site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use illustrations to help visitors understand your content</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review Redish's scale for how we can use pictures on websites, from representational to emotional (273 &amp;ff)</li>
<li>Look at the size of images; consider an appropriate size for images and don't let large pictures push content down too far (281), this may especially be an issue with some WP templates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Check how your site looks on multiple devices</h2>
<ul>
<li>How does your webtext look on mobile?</li>
<li>On a computer with a small screen?</li>
<li>On a high-res monitor?</li>
</ul>
