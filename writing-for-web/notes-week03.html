<h1>On looking AT the Internet</h1>
<p><em>"The romance of the Net came not from how it was built or how it worked but from how it was used. By 1980 the Net was far more than a collection of computers and leased lines. It was a place to share work and build friendships and a more open method of communication. America's romance with the highway system, by analogy, was created not so much by the first person who figured out how to grade a road or make blacktop or paint a stripe down the middle but by the first person who discovered you could drive a convertible down Route 66 like James Dean and play your radio loud and have a great time." (Hafner &amp; Lyon, 1996, p. 218)</em></p>
<p>Most people probably haven't spent a great deal of time thinking about the Internet, computers, and how they work. That assumption of the transparency of computers in our lives, which has come with the ubiquity of computers mediating our lives, is becoming an increasingly troubled position today. Incomplete understanding of technology is dangerous. Uncritical embrace of technology is risky. It's not elves running it, after all... As <a href="https://w2.eff.org/Net_culture/internet_sterling.history.txt">the classic argument goes</a>:</p>
<p><em>"Learning the Internet now, or at least learning about it, is wise. By the turn of the century, 'network literacy,' like 'computer literacy' before it, will be forcing itself into the very texture of your life." (Sterling, 1993, par. 40)</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>One book on the history of the 'net that I particularly enjoy is Katie Hafner's <em><a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Where-Wizards-Stay-Up-Late/Katie-Hafner/9780684832678">Where Wizards Stay Up Late</a></em>, an engaging (if vaguely utopian) narrative history of the Internet, specifically the development of ARPA and the ARPANET, the role of BNN (a computer company that was the "center of gravity" of many of the scientists and engineers who developed the first computer networks) and the centerpiece technologies and models that changed computing from something done in single rooms or (sometimes) single buildings to something done... everywhere. Writers used to use the metaphor of a "superhighway" to talk about the Internet, back when it was this amazing new thing, an unusually fast way to retrieve information. But now that everything is fast and everything is on the internet and the connections are everywhere, that metaphor seems to have passed away. It's just so... usual.</p>

<p>Hafner and Lyon repeatedly point to the Internet being founded on values like openness and sharing, on collaboration instead of ego, and a certain level of noncomformism (undermining both the corporate protectionism of AT&amp;T and the net's status as a primarily military and academic work mechanism). There's some strong similarity here to how Sterling framed things in his "Short History."</p>
<p>The Internet, Sterling argued, is inherently decentralized, without a central authority, and operating even in tatters&mdash;something that (according to history as well as the most excited projective aspirations of futurist Kevin Kelly) lives beyond the particular technical configurations of ARPA's servers or how programmers design a protocol to work. Again and again, the narrative of the internet is rooted in subversion. Need to subvert military R&amp;D siloing? Network. Need to beware the bomb? Network. Design the 'net for long-distance computing? Email and BBSes. Need a movie and don't want to pay? Torrent. For Sterling, the "true, modern, functional anarchy" of the network becomes both humanistically and economically more valuable as it becomes messier. It's all about users, and the Internet is an important source of personal agency for users as individuals as well as groups. This is a much different history of the Internet than the sparkling techno-centric overview offered in this "History of the Internet" video, no? And then there's Google. Started as an academic (!!!) project that looks at the nature of hypertextual relationships, then turned into the way we use the Internet today. This is a slightly different conversation&mdash;one where it's not the users that define the content, but the companies and their economics that define the content that users get to see.</p>
<p>At the center of a lot of this&mdash;er, distributed and distributing across the nodes of every part of this network, part of the network's very becoming, according to Sterling and many others, is one little genre, occasionally studied but more often invisible, as many of our most-used technologies are. The email. (I wrote my dissertation on the technorhetorics of a particular email LISTSERV, so the tool has a soft spot in my heart.)</p>
<p>The following passage from "The Phantom Machine: The Invisible Ideology of Email," reiterates how and why technology becomes invisible and innocuous:</p>
<p><em>Communication situations, practices, and technologies are social constructions that become invisible as they move from categories of nominal experience. Even those partially or wholly dependent on technology disappear as they are regarded as naturally occurring phenomena in a socially, culturally, and economically constructed landscape. Once naturalized, communication technology becomes as seemingly innocuous as nature (Moses &amp; Katz, 2006, p. 71).</em></p>
<p>Moses and Katz are describing email. <a href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/essays/pencils.htm">Dennis Baron</a> says the same about pencils and handwriting. I'm saying the same about the Internet and digital techs in general here. It's in your pocket, but it's invisible. That's a very powerful and fraught relationship.</p>

<p>Back to the history of the Internet. Of course, these kinds of histories also offer other narratives in subtexts: closed circles of expertise, user-hostile environments, and a world that seemingly existed without women other than the ones that prepared dinner for or gave birth to the children of the otherwise free-agent male programmers and researchers. As in many office and technical domains, the factually significant roles of women are overlooked by historical narratives. For some females, their subjectivity (I won't ask your pardon for the tangent) disappears as the body becomes office machinery (an analog is the use of typists, transcriptionists, and typing pools as industries grew in the early 20th century; the "typewriter" as first used was a term that could refer either to the machine or the woman. More properly, it probably refers to the cyborgian unit. The stenographer typist of the 1930s was, according to Carol Siri Johnson, the "midwife of technical communication," but her place has long been overlooked in the field (2009, p. 150), which often defines the "beginning" of tech comm with World War II.). Other women are quite simply not seen in the histories. Until the last few years, how often did we have female tech experts on our favorite prime-time television shows? (Did you know the first computer programmer was a woman? (Yes, there's disagreement about that. Rhetoric.))</p>
<p>Our tools, just like our cultures, transmit values and perspectives. While writing for the web is certainly about creating punchy headlines, carefully sectioning content for usability, and making sure links and images meet accesibility guidelines, it's also about thinking carefully about the Internet itself, about our technical value systems (ease, efficiency, determinism), and the social/historical issues that surround communication on the Web.</p>

<h2>A few notes from the text of <em>Wizards</em> for the interested:</h2>
<ul>
<li>ARPA was developed as a R&amp;D wing to overcome military branch rivalry over R&amp;D programs. This was a serious problem Eisenhower wanted to solve by the late 50s. (ARPA is from the beginning about getting beyond rivaly) (p. 14).</li>
<li>Researcher at MIT and eventual leader in ARPA J.C.R. Licklider "was far more than just a computer enthusiast, however. For several years, he had been touting a radical and visionary notion: that c<strong>omputers weren't just adding machines. Computers had the potential to act as extensions of the whole human being, as tools that could amplify the range of human intelligence and expand the reach of our analytical power</strong>." (p. 27)</li>
<ul>
<li>He was an early thinker about 'symbiosis', "where the machine functions as a problem-solving partner" (31) Human as decision-maker, computer as speedy analyzer/calculator.</li>
</ul>
<li>E-mail plays a central role in the growth/development of the network, but "the ARPANET was not intended as a message system. In the minds of its inventors, the network was intended for resource-sharing, period. That very little of its capacity was actually ever used for resource-sharing was a fact soon submersed in the tide of electronic mail." (189)</li>
<li>"The big rise in message traffic was to become the largest early force in the network's growth and development. E-mail was to the ARPANET what the Louisiana Purchase was to the young United States. Things only got better as the network grew and technology converged with the torrential human tendency to talk." (189)</li>
<ul>
<li>"Proclamations of officialness didn't further the Net nearly so much as throwing technology out onto the net to see what worked. And when something worked, it was adopted." (205)</li>
<li>"a pragmatic attitude toward technical invention--build it, throw it out on the Net, and fix it if it breaks" (258)</li>
</ul>
