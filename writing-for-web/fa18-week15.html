<p>How far we've come!</p>
<p></p>
<p>This schedule should look familiar to anyone who looked at last week's schedule! Here's what's going down over the next week:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You should be basically done with your text-to-hypertext at this point, maybe with a few minor issues to wrap up today. Spend the rest of the week <strong>writing reflectively about major projects</strong> and r<strong>evising your portfolio to get it in superb shape by or before Wednesday, May 10</strong>. I will be happy to provide specific answers to questions or troubleshooting, but since it's the last week of class and everyone's turning things in, please be sure to contact me sooner rather than later.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><strong>Monday, May 1 (end of the day)</strong>: Yourwebsite for the text-to-hypertext projectis due by the end of the day on Monday, May 1. You'll need to add a subheaded section with a link to your portfolio's project page. Don't forget to include a short, bite- or snack-sized description of this on your portfolio's project page. Email me when you've got it all completed!</li>
</ul><p></p>
<ul><li><strong>Friday, May 5 (end of the day)</strong>: Write areflection about your text-to-hypertext projectand post it as a page or blog post linked from your portfolio projects page. Connect what you've done with your website to your own learning goals and our course goals (<a href="/w/page/114444250/3379%20Spring%202017%20Home#ABOUTOURCOURSE">see the top of our syllabus</a>). This should be in the realm of 250-500 words, should be written according to the best principles of writing for the web, and should have a meaningful title and key message. Bite, Snack, Meal and all that!</li>
</ul><p></p>
<ul><li><strong>Wednesday, May 10 (Noon, CST)</strong>: This is the final day to submit a link to yourcompleted portfolio. This must include final, polished version of all content, including (but not limited to) the following. Most of these are completed already, and should only need a quick polish or revision.</li>
<ul><li>A home page that does what a home page is supposed to do, including a short, revised rationale (~250 words) that describes your experience in Web writing and design and learning goals for Web writing and development. Employ bite/snack/meal, and write TO your reader.</li>
<li>A bio page that's all about YOU.</li>
<li><span style="background-color:#ffcc99;font-size:115%;">Your contact information</li>
<ul><li>This does not necessarily have to be a contact page or contact form; this could be a widget somewhere on your site.</li>
</ul><li>A projects page that lists and links to all completed projects for the course, including a short (think bite-sized) description of each.</li>
<ul><ul><li><strong>To reiterate: List completed projects, include bite/snack descriptions of each project. Link to projects. Use headings and subheadings.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your projects page is a pathway page, not a content page. Structure and write for it accordingly!</strong></li>
</ul><li>Include links to each of your class projects.</li>
<li>Include links to reflections you wrote for the Codecademy and Text-to-Hypertext projects.</li>
<li>Include a link to a new, reflective text about your portfolio and its development over the semester..</li>
<ul><li>Much like the text-to-hypertext and html reflections, connect what you've done in your portfolio to your learning goals and our course goals (<a href="/w/page/114444250/3379%20Spring%202017%20Home#ABOUTOURCOURSE">they're at the top of our syllabus</a>). Like other reflections, this should be in the realm of 250-500 words, should be written according to best principles of writing for the web, and should have a meaningful title and key message.</li>
</ul><li>Include links to at least three representative writing samples taken from your Wednesday discussion posts, showing off your best and most thoughtful writing. Use the brief descriptions on your projects page to set the context for these.</li>
<ul><li>Do not post the full text of your writing samples to the projects page. Use your projects page to link to writing samples, which could be published as blog posts or static pages on your portfolio or solo HTML pages in GitHub.</li>
</ul><li>You may add or link to other projects youâ€™ve completed for other courses that you think are portfolio-worthy.</li>
</ul><li><span style="color:#ff6600;font-size:115%;"><strong>Submit your portfolio for the third and final check<em>no later than</em>NOON on Wednesday, May 10.</strong></li>
<ul><li>Send me an email with the subject line "Lastname FINAL Portfolio."</li>
<li>You may submit completed portfolios early.</li>
</ul></ul></ul>
