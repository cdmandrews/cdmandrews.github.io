<h1>Copyright &amp; Fair Use</h1>
<p>Disclaimer: We can't cover all of copyright law in a week or two. There are all sorts of related issues (such as DMCA) that we just can't really get to but that I encourage you to think about. As with many such legal questions, copyright law is all carefully negotiated and constructed, and changes as our society changes. That's part of why it's so frustrating to keep track of.</p>
<h2>What is copyright?</h2>
<p>Copyright falls under the aegis of the US Congress. Congress has the power: "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries" (US Constitution Art I, Sec. 8).Today, copyright protections are codified and provided for in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976" target="_blank">Copyright Act of 1976</a> (which has been amended a number of times) and the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
<p>Copyright is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a protection intended to expand, stimulate, and protect the creation of authored works by giving authors the right to prevent others from copying and thus exploiting their work.</li>
<li>technically a limitation of free speech; the doctrine of <strong>fair use</strong> is intended to deal with this limitation.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This relationship between protection and limitation is tricky. Copyright law is intended to inspire creation and productivity by making creation economically viable, but it does so by limiting creation and setting up a system that occasionally rubs our oversimplifications of the concept of free speech the wrong way.</em></p>
<h2>What exclusive rights do copyright holders have?</h2>
<p>Note: authors are not necessarily copyright holders; copyright can be sold or contracted away in an agreement; the creators of many famous comic book characters, for example, hold no copyright on their creations; publishing companies hold exclusive rights to their creations.</p>
<p>Copyright holders, when they publish their works, have exclusive right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>reproduction,</li>
<li>creation of derivative works,</li>
<li>distribution,</li>
<li>performance,</li>
<li>display</li>
</ul>
<p>This protection is only for a certain amount of time (though each successive revision of copyright law has managed to<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tom_Bell%27s_graph_showing_extension_of_U.S._copyright_term_over_time.svg" target="_blank">extend the term</a> that copyright holders have exclusive rights to their creations before they become part of the public domain). In the US</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first version of the law, copyright was 28 years (with possible extension of 28 years that one could apply for).</li>
<li>In 1976, this was raised to the author's life +50 years, or 75 years for works made for hire.</li>
<li>In 1998, this was raised to the author's life +70 years, or 95 years for works made for hire.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is protected by copyright?</h3>
<ul>
<li>literary, musical, and dramatic works</li>
<li>pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works</li>
<li>audiovisual works and sound recordings</li>
<li>choreographic works</li>
<li>architectural works</li>
<li>derivative works</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is not protected by copyright?</h3>
<ul>
<li>ideas, facts, data</li>
<li>logos/taglines</li>
<li>works created by the government</li>
<li>works in the public domain (any work published on or before December 31, 1922)</li>
</ul>
<p>Works in the <strong>public domain</strong>are works whose original copyright protections have expired or that were created before applicable copyright protections. Creators may also forfeittheir copyright or decide to donate something to the public domain. Works in the public domain may be freely used by anyone for any purpose without restriction.</p>
<h2>What is Fair Use?</h2>
<p>Fair Use is a copyright principle based on the belief that the public is entitled to use portions of copyrighted materials without permission for the purpose of commentary and criticism. In the US, fair use is codified and provided for in the Copyright Act of 1976.</p>
<p>In conversations about fair use, transformativeness is an important term. <strong>Transformativeness</strong> is the derivative use of a copyrighted work that makes it transcend the underlying work by adding new value to and repurposing the work, often for a new audience. A general fair use guideline is "use no more than necessary to achieve the transformative purpose." More specifically, we (well, copyright judges) use four factors to determine if someone's use of copyrighted material is protected under the Constitution.</p>


<h2>4 Factors of Fair Use</h2>
<p>The four factors are guidelines: interpretive statements that judges consider rather than clearly-drawn lines that you can march up to, stand behind, and claim fair use for any old thing you create. Each factor has its own gray areas and potential to upset the balance when considering if a use is in fact fair use, and they can interact in different ways depending on use, context, and what content is being used.</p>
<p>I've put factors and types of use into this document for quick reference; these are based on the UT library guide about the Four Factors at <a href="http://guides.lib.utexas.edu/copyright/fourfactors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://guides.lib.utexas.edu/copyright/fourfactors</a>, which you should review before completing this week's assignment. The Association of Research Libraries has an interesting infographic about its work as well as other useful resources on fair use.</p>
<h3>Factor 1: What is the purpose and character of the use of a copyrighted work?</h3>
<p>The key concept here is "transformative" &mdash; a transformative work adds value to the original and repurposes it for new audiences. Uses on the left are strongly transformative,</p>

<h3>Factor 3: What is the amount and substantiality of what is used from the copyrighted work?</h3>
<p>Remember that the three factors are related, and relative amount is tricky. A commercial use will generally need permission even for small amounts, while nonprofit and educational uses can use much larger amounts under fair use (i.e. an entire journal article copied to a class).</p>

<td><strong>more likely to be fair use</strong></td>

<td>
<p>Small amount (For example, 1 chapter, 10%)</p>
<p>Appropriate amount for transformative purpose</p>
</td>
<td>More than a small amount or the amount <br />needed to accomplish a transformative purpose</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Factor 4: What is the effect of use on the market for the copyrighted work?</h3>
<p>If the kind of use were widespread, how would this affect the market for the original or for permissions, especially if there's a market for providing content licenses for the way you want it. This is really about reducing the risk of harm to the copyright owner, who wants to get paid for her work.</p>
