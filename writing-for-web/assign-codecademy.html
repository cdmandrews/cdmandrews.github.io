<h1>Codecademy HTML and CSS Modules</h1>
<p>This project asks you to complete a series of HTML and CSS tutorials on Codecademy and post them to a github website you will create. These will be linked to the projects page of your web portfolio. When you're finished with all six exercises, you'll write a reflection and post it to your portfolio site.This assignment will do double duty (maybe triple):</p>
<ol>
<li>You will learn the very basics of HTML and CSS coding. You'll be "under the hood" of web writing, so to speak. This also allows us to talk about distinctions between style and content and a host of other issues. And in a world of WYSIWYG editors and content management systems, a little HTML goes a long way.</li>
<li>You will learn how to post and manage files on a small web account you set up through GitHub. You'll add a tool to your toolbox, know a little something about publishing HTML files in "the wild," and will have the beginnings of a repository that you can use as you move out into the world, if you choose to. This will also lead us into a number of conversations about being public on the web, professional personas, and other issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following step-by-step instructions are a little intimidating lengthwise, but the process is honestly quite simple. If you have questions, please use the #troubleshooting Slack channel, and I will get you fixed up.</p>
<h2>Step 0: View this slideshow and read the full instructions</h2>

<h2>Step 1: Create your accounts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create both a GitHub account (skip to Step 3 if you want to go ahead and create your repository) and a Codecademy account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is possible to finish the Codecademy exercises without making an account on the site, but creating your (free) account means that you'll be able to save your progress and see what you've completed in the past.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Complete the exercises<img src="Screen%20Shot%202017-02-01%20at%202.40.40%20PM.png" alt="" width="299" height="283" /></h2>
<p>Complete the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web">HTML &amp; CSS Exercises at Codecademy</a>. Codecademy is a great set of introductory tutorials for a variety of different coding skills. We'll be doing all six of the tutorials for for HTML and CSS:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introduction to HTML</li>
  <ol>
    <li>You'll post "Build Your Own Webpage"</li>
  </ol>
  <li>HTML Structure: Using Lists</li>
  <ol>
    <li>You'll post "Social Networking Profile"</li>
  </ol>
  <li>HTML Structure: Tables, Divs, and Spans</li>
  <ol>
    <li>You'll post "Clickable Photo Page"</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Introduction to CSS</li>
  <ol>
    <li>You'll post "Design a Button"</li>
  </ol>
  <li>CSS Classes and IDs</li>
  <ol>
    <li>You'll post "Sorting your Friends"</li>
  </ol>
  <li>CSS Element Positioning</li>
  <ol>
    <li>YOu'll post "Build a Resume"</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>See the course schedule for the deadline on completing these exercises.</p>
<p>When you complete each of these units, you will need to <a href="https://youtu.be/sBxpZWmScRE">create a version of each project suitable for publication on your GitHub account</a>. An easy way to do this is to copy the code from the exercise and paste it into a plaintext editor. (I use TextWranglr on Macs and Notepad++ on PCs, but you can do this in any plaintext editor.) Save your code as an .html file rather than a .txt file. If you click on your new .html file, it should open up in your default browser, and you can see what you've got!</p>
<p>I'll talk you through this further, but you can start out by checking my GitHub website tutorial.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Upload your files to GitHub</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBxpZWmScRE?rel=0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Github is a lot of things, but we're going to use it to create simple HTML repositories. Create a repository for your site by following this walkthrough: <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/</a>. Pay special attention to Step 2; if you get the new repository name wrong this will not work. You do not need worry about the Jekyll setup, steps 7-end.</p>
<p>Upload the HTML and CSS files you've created in Codecademy to your GitHub repository you created using the walkthrough. A nice thing about GitHub is that it'll allow you to edit your HTML and CSS files right there on the site. No muss no fuss after initial creation or upload. You'll be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/sBxpZWmScRE">create your work on Codecademy and then copy/paste them into new HTML pages on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Reflect on your experience</h2>
<p>Write a short (500-1000 words) reflection on your experiences with these tutorials. <em>What about these exercises frustrated you and/or that you found too easy? What was your proudest moment with these HTML/CSS exercises? What do you want to learn more about with HTML and CSS?</em></p>
<p>You will post your reflection on your portfolio site. You can use the blog for this and other reflective texts, or you can set up a static page.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Publish links to your exercises and reflection on the projects page of your portfolio site.</h2>
<p>After you've linked everything to your projects page, email me and let me know you're done. Include the subject line "Yourlastname Codecademy done."</p>
<h2>A few more details about all this:</h2>
<p>There might be (okay, will be) some bumps along the way! Glitches and bumps are, frankly, part of writing on the web. Be patient, ask questions, and try again.</p>
<p>If you follow the instructions and are comfortable working through these things on your own, you can progress at your own pace on these exercises. Some of you might be able to finish this in one sitting! If you have questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, post your question to the #troubleshooting Slack channel. Maybe someone else has the same question and/or an answer.</li>
  <li>Second, if you email me a question, realize that I will probably wait at least a few hours before emailing you back. I have three children, and they tend to yell louder when I check email instead of playing with them.</li>
  <li>Third, f you email me a question, recognize that I will likely ask you to re-post your question to the #troubleshooting Slack channel. It's not because I don't want to answer, but because I'd rather do so in the larger forum.</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, I did all of these, too! <a href="https://cdmandrews.github.io/codecademy/">Here is the link to my completed Codecademy exercises</a>.</p>
