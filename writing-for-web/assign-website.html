<h2>Website analysis (10% of final grade)</h2>
<p>This analysis will be somewhat like you’ve been doing in your weekly posts, but it will be an <strong>extended</strong> (at least 1000 words in length) and <strong>more formal</strong> version. Your task:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Analyze two informational websites</li>
  <ol>
    <li>See the video for my discussion of "informational websites."</li>
    <li>We've been posting about these kinds of sites in the forums for a few weeks by now.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Describe the sites’ audiences</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Some sites will have one general audience profile, other sites will have multiple profiles. You should be able to derive these answers from the websites themselves via clues from the sites’ design and text.</li>
    <li>Chapter 2 of <em>Letting go of the Words</em>is about audiences, visitors, and personae. </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Evaluate the sites’ strengths and weaknesses</li>
  <ol>
    <li>The key word here is <strong>evaluate.</strong>Donot just describe. When you evaluate, you judge the worth of something based on criteria (<em>principles or standards on which something can be judged</em>).</li>
    <li>For this assignment, you must select and define criteria from Redish’s textbook <strong>and</strong> at least one other text we’ve read together.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>"Select" is important. Your 1000-word post cannot cover every element described in <em>Letting go of the Words.</em></li>
      <li>"Define" is important. You'll need to explain those criteria, citing from Redish and other authors you've selected to work from.</li>
      <li>You must use Redish.</li>
      <li>You must also apply one other text we've read.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Most of the body of your post will assess the two websites based on the criteria you’ve selected and defined.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>Apply</strong> what you've been learning and use the bite, snack, meal (Redish, p. 134) approach in your post. Include a meaningful headline, start with your key message, break up your information and use subheadings that will help me read your content.</p>
<p>Include hyperlinks to both of the sites you analyze and a bibliography in MLA or APA format.</p>
<p>The entire post (not counting your bibliography) should be at least 1000 words long.</p>
