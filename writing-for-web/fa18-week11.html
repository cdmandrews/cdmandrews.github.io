<p>Remember that your initial discussion forum posts are due before 7:00pm on Wednesdays. Your replies to others' posts are due by 11:59pm on Wednesdays.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discussion forums are on Blackboard. Go to the "Discussion Forums" link under the "Assignments" category in our blackboard course and select the appropriate forum:<a href="https://bb9.tamucc.edu/">https://bb9.tamucc.edu</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>This week is a big get-to-work week: Spend a few hours working on your website, update your peers on how things are going by Wednesday, and meet with me individually about your project's status</strong></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Conferences:</h2>
<p>You should have already scheduled your conference with me via the doodle poll at <a style="font-family:'Segoe UI', 'Lucida Grande', Arial, sans-serif;font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;" href="http://doodle.com/poll/kcqkyeds246f37is">http://doodle.com/poll/kcqkyeds246f37is</a><span style="font-family:'Segoe UI', 'Lucida Grande', Arial, sans-serif;font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;"></p>

<p>Conferences will be half-hour blocks; you may schedule more than one conference if you like. I also welcome small groups.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These will be working sessions. Come ready to talk with me, get your fingers in your project, and work on your text. We will have 25-30 minutes to chat, especially if you're among back-to-back appointments. Please be on time and have your materials ready to go.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Things you should bring and have ready for our conference*:</strong></p>
<ol><li>Your laptop if you have one.</li>
<li>Your original print-designed text (you are not required to print this out).</li>
<li>Any drawings, sketches, or cards that you've used to develop your site (if they're transportable).</li>
<li>Your working draft of your hypertext. A working draft is something you've begun; it doesn't have to be finished or even particularly good, but it does have to be some legitimate in-progress work that you've spent time on.</li>
<li>Questions that you need answered, specific problems you'd like to work on, or designs and text you'd like to review. Come with an agenda of your own. I will have questions I want to ask you, but this is *your* time to have my 100% individual attention. Take advantage of it!</li>
<li>Showing up empty-handed is about as useful as not showing up.</li>
</ol><p></p>
<p style="margin-left:80px;">*If you're meeting with me via telephone or WebEx, please have all these items at the ready and your Islander email up as well, in case we need to send documents to one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For online meetings, we will use WebEx, an online collaboration and meeting tool provided by the University. Visit <a href="https://iol.tamucc.edu/webex.html">https://iol.tamucc.edu/webex.html</a> to learn more. In my experience, the tool works best in Firefox. I encourage those using WebEx the first time to try logging in and getting your account set up a few hours before the meeting. It's not a bad idea to log in to WebEx via iol.tamucc.edu a few minutes our conference to ensure your connection, video, and microphone are working correctly.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Complete for Wednesday</h2>
<p>Your Wednesday post will be very straightforward this week:</p>
<ol><li>Before 7:00 pm on Wednesday, start a new thread in the<span style="font-size:100%;color:#ff6600;"><strong>Week 11 forum</strong>on Blackboard:<em>Update your classmates on your work and on problems or questions you have. Share struggles, successes, and hacks. If you've got a link to show--even if it's all still very rough--go ahead and do so! </em></li>
<li>Review other students' responses in the forum, and respond in kind. Answer questions, lead cheers, and consult together about problems. If you've got a helpful resource, please share it! Reply, respond, discuss. Your replies are due by 11:59 pm on Wednesday.</li>
</ol><p></p>
<h2>There is no work due this Friday</h2>
<p>(work on your website)</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Next Week:</h2>
<p>By April 14, you need to have a draft of your hypertext ready for me and your peers to review. This might be your Wordpress or Google website posted online, or it might be a collection of html files you're working up and have placed on GitHub; whichever way, it should be a draft of your hypertext and not simply a draft of your paper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next week we'll also read and write about copyright, copyleft, fair use, and the public domain. Some of you have been asking about how to deal with media you're thinking of using, and we'll answer all your questions, offer useful (and ethical/legal) strategies, and more!</p>
<p></p>
