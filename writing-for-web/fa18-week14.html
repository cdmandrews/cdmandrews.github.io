<p>Spend this week working on your websites! Last week, I emailed feedback to everyone that submitted a website link to me. You may certainly send me an updated link this week if you'd like another round of feedback.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Checklist of key due dates for the next two weeks:</h2>
<p></p>
<ul><li><strong>Friday, April 28 (5:00 pm CST)</strong>: Final day to submit extra Codecademy HTML modules if you've completed them. You'll upload these to your Github repository as before, and add a subheaded section with links on your portfolio's project page. If you'd like to have credit for these, please email me a link to your *updated* profile page no later than 5:00 pm on Friday, April 28.</li>
<li><strong>Monday, May 1 (end of the day)</strong>: Your website for the text-to-hypertext project is due by the end of the day on Monday, May 1. You'll need to add a subheaded section with a link to your portfolio's project page. Don't forget to include a short, bite- or snack-sized description of this on your portfolio's project page. Email me when you've got it all completed!</li>
<li><strong>Friday, May 5 (end of the day)</strong>: Write a reflection about your text-to-hypertext project and post it as a page or blog post linked from your portfolio projects page. Connect what you've done with your website to your own learning goals and our course goals (<a href="/w/page/114444250/3379%20Spring%202017%20Home#ABOUTOURCOURSE">see the top of our syllabus</a>). This should be in the realm of 250-500 words, should be written according to the best principles of writing for the web, and should have a meaningful title and key message. Bite, Snack, Meal and all that!</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday, May 10 (Noon, CST)</strong>: This is the final day to submit a link to your completed portfolio. This must include final, polished version of all content, including (but not limited to) the following. Most of these are completed already, and should only need a quick polish or revision.</li>
<ul><li>A home page that does what a home page is supposed to do, including a short, revised rationale (~250 words) that describes your experience in Web writing and design and learning goals for Web writing and development. Employ bite/snack/meal, and write TO your reader.</li>
<li>A bio page that's all about YOU.</li>
<li>Your contact information </li>
<ul><li>This does not necessarily have to be a contact page or contact form; this could be a widget somewhere on your site.</li>
</ul><li>A projects page that lists and links to all completed projects for the course, including a short (think bite-sized) description of each.</li>
<ul><li><strong>Your projects page is a pathway page, not a content page. Structure and write for it accordingly!</strong></li>
<li>Include links to each of your class projects.</li>
<li>Include links to reflections you wrote for the Codecademy and Text-to-Hypertext projects.</li>
<li>Include a link to a new, reflective text about your portfolio and its development over the semester..</li>
<ul><li>Much like the text-to-hypertext and html reflections, connect what you've done in your portfolio to your learning goals and our course goals (<a href="/w/page/114444250/3379%20Spring%202017%20Home#ABOUTOURCOURSE">they're at the top of our syllabus</a>). Like other reflections, this should be in the realm of 250-500 words, should be written according to best principles of writing for the web, and should have a meaningful title and key message.</li>
</ul><li>Include links to at least three representative writing samples taken from your Wednesday discussion posts, showing off your best and most thoughtful writing. Use the brief descriptions on your projects page to set the context for these.</li>
<ul><li>Do not post the full text of your writing samples to the projects page. Use your projects page to link to writing samples, which could be published as blog posts or static pages on your portfolio or solo HTML pages in GitHub.</li>
</ul><li>You may add or link to other projects youâ€™ve completed for other courses that you think are portfolio-worthy.</li>
</ul><li><strong>Submit your portfolio for the third and final check <em>no later than</em> NOON on Wednesday, May 10. </strong></li>
<ul><li>Send me an email with the subject line "Lastname FINAL Portfolio."</li>
<li>You may submit completed portfolios early.</li>
</ul></ul></ul><p></p>
