  <h1>ENGL 3379: Writing for the Web, Fall 2018</h1>
  <p>Online course over developing effective, usable, and accessible content for web sites. Lots and lots of writing practice. Taught by <a href="http:cdmandrews.github.io">Dr. Christopher Andrews</a> in Fall 2018</p>
  <p>All information on this page should not be considered final until the end of the first full week of classes, as I update and change outdated or incorrect information. Even after that point, our schedule and assignments should be considered a hard "tentative" and are subject to some change. I will discuss all such changes with you, and will provide said changes in writing.</p>

<h2>Assignments: what you'll do this semester</h2>
<h3>Reading responses ()</h3>
<p>You will write 10 responses to (often applications of) readings as discussion posts on Blackboard. (This is pretty much the only thing we'll use Blackboard for. We will complete other posts connected with assignments.) Each of your responses should be a substantial discussion and application of the readings; I will provide instructions and a prompt for each discussion post in my initial post for each week. See blackboard rubrics for details about evaluation criteria.These will normally be in the neighborhood of 500 words long. You'll also reply and respond to others' posts.Failling to do so will result in loss of points. <a href="discussionrubric.html">Rubric for evaluation</a>.</p>

<h3>Codecademy modules ()</h3>
<p>This project asks you to complete a series of HTML &amp; CSS tutorials on Codecademy and post them to a GitHub website you will create. These will be linked to the projects page of your web portfolio. When you're finished with all six exercises, you'll write a reflection and post it to your portfolio site.</p>
<p>This assignment will do double duty (maybe triple):</p>
<ol>
<li>You will learn the very basics of HTML and CSS coding. You'll be "under the hood" of web writing, so to speak. This also allows us to talk about distinctions between style and content and a host of other issues. And in a world of WYSIWYG editors and content management systems, a little HTML goes a long way.</li>
<li>You will learn how to set up, post, and manage files on a small web account via GitHub. You'll add a tool to your toolbox, know a little something about publishing HTML files in "the wild," and will have the beginnings of a repository that you can use as you move out into the world, if you choose to. This will also lead us into a number of conversations about being public on the web, professional personas, and other issues.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="assign-codecademy.html">The step-by-step instructions look long, but that is deceptive</a>. If you have questions, please use the #troubleshooting Slack channel, and I will get you fixed up.</p>

<h3>Website analysis ()</h3>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtqScmLaRL4?rel=0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Analyze two informational websites of your choice. Who is the site's audience? What are the site's strengths &amp; weaknesses? Apply concepts from our course readings in your analysis and evaluation; you must apply (and cite) concepts from Redish and at least one other text we've read to this point. Post your analysis to the appropriate discussion board in Blackboard and then respond to two of your classmates' work. Don't forget to include hyperlinks to both sites and a bibliography in MLA or APA format. This should be at least 1000 words long.</p>
<p><a href="assign-website.html">Full description of your assignment</a>.</p>
<h2>Text-to-Hypertext ()</h2>
<p>Take a designed-for-print text and recreate it as a web-based hypertext. Apply what you've learned in Redish and other texts we're working through this semester to redesign a research paper, long essay, or other appropriate "born print" text you've written into a website.</p>
<p>just porting some text over from a Microsoft Word document into HTML/CSS, Dreamweaver, or Wordpress is not enough to produce an effective website. Making it rhetorically effective and easy for the reader to navigate provides different challenges on the screen than on the page. You will create a hypertextual, multimodal document meant to be used and experienced online. It should also be "good" based on the advice we'll be reading about this term.</p>
<p><a href="assign-t2h.html">Full description of your assignment</a>.</p>

<h3>Web portfolio ()</h3>
<p>You will develop a personalized Web portfolio to showcase work completed in this course, using any Web development platform (most likely a Wordpress blog). The portfolio must include the following: home page, biography, projects page, and contact information. You may add other sections to your portfolio according to your needs and style, but these are not required.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The home page should include a short rationale (250 words) that describes your previous experience in Web design and learning goals for Web writing and development.</li>
<li>The projects page should include initially a list of forthcoming projects for the course and short description of each. You will eventually link the actual projects to this page. You will also include at least three representative writing samples taken from your discussion posts, showing off your best and most thoughtful writing. You may eventually add or link to other projects you've completed for other courses that you think are portfolio-worthy. You will eventually link to your HTML exercises from Codecademy via your GitHub repository.</li>
<li>Your portfolio must be accessible on the World Wide Web and improved over the duration of the course.</li>
<li>Your final portfolio will include a reflective statement.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>One immediate 'learning curve' issue will be determining how to use WordPress for static pages rather than blog posts. Instructions:</p>
<p>Later in the term, you will post links, text or multimedia content, and short descriptions for each course assignment as you complete them. To submit the Web portfolio assignment, you will post a link to your wiki page by the appropriate date.</p>
<p>I will check your portfolio for credit three times:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Early check (week 2, you should have a first design and all required pages as described in the sections above)</li>
<li>Mid-term (after spring break, you should have projects updated according to what we've completed in the course thus far; revisions and improvements should be evident)</li>
<li>Finals week (completed portfolio, should include final versions of all content, with polished revisions and improvements evident)</li>
</ol>
