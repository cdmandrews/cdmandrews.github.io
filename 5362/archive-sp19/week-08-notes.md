## Praxis: Distant reading

Backup thoughts on wordclouds.

- [Sydney's *Enculturation* wordclouds](https://sydneyspangler.github.io/distant-reading-project/)

Some questions and thoughts and [ideas](ideas):
- What is our distant reading's account of these texts?
- What sort of knowledge do we need to make use of these clouds?
- What kind of systematic data coding (and preparation) would we need to do to make better use of our initial distant reading?
- What happens (does/can anything happen) when we place these alongside Eyman's discussion of the "primary activities in the field of digital rhetoric"?
  - the use of rhetorical strategies in production and analysis of digital texts
  - identifying characteristics, affordances, and constraints of new media
  - formation of digital identities
  - potential for building social communities (first four from Zappen, 2005, p. 319)
  - inquiry and development of rhetorics of technology
  - the use of rhetorical methods for uncovering and interrogating ideologies and cultural formation in digital work
  - an examination of the rhetorical function of networks
  - theorization of agency when interlocutors are as likely to be software agents (or “spimes”) as they are human actors (full list from Eyman, 2015, ch 1.)



## Praxis: More CSS
Do yourself a favor and turn off CSS resets if you want to. Save yourself some stress and love on those defaults a bit.

Essentials include:
  - everything's a box
  - normal flow
  - block & inline elements
  - floats
  - positioning
  - layouts (grid, flexbox, multicolumn)

- [the box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)
- To clear all default styles, add [Eric Meyer's CSS Reset styles](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) to the top of your `.css` file.

## Theoria: Ecology? Techne? I dunno?

- Brooke 3 (Proairesis[invention])
  - "Actions or events that fail to move the reader toward the resolution of the hermenutic enigma are quite literally extravagant: They are off track and may even be resented as wasteful or distracting. What would it mean, however, to focus on the practice of proairesis and to do so without subordinating it to hermeneutics?" (p. 76-77)
- Brooke 4 (Pattern[arrangement])
  - "Just because there is more than one way to walk through a building, this does not make its arrangement (architecture) irrelevant" (p. 91)
- Brooke 5 (Perspective[style])
  - "Proper" is what some group of people has agreed upon, and no more. The "contingent, consensual qualities of that agreement are eventually forgotten, leaving a normed or proper name for which metaphors are described as deviations" (p. 124).
- Brooke 6 (Persistence[memory])
  - "Persistence as a memory practice is the ability to build and maintain patterns although those patterns may be tentative and ultimately fade into the background.” (Brooke, p. 157)
- Brooke 7 (Performance[delivery])
  - "Particularly in the case of delivery we must consciously resist the impulse to reduce that canon to a transitive, instrumental process of transmission." (Brooke, p. 178).

- Haas (2007), Wampum as hypertext: An American Indian intellectual tradition of multimedia theory and practice
  - counterstory to Western claims of originating hypertext and multimedia
  - wampum belts extended human memories of inherited knowledges through interconnected, nonlinear designs and associative storage and retrieval methods
  - concern about responsibility for digital and visual rhetorical sovereignty
- Ridolfo & DeVoss (2009), Composing for recomposition: Rhetorical velocity and delivery
  - propose new concepts: rhetorical velocity, and composing for strategic recomposition
  - conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party
  - concern for telos
- Porter (2009), Recovering delivery
- Lambke (2019), Arranging delivery, delivering arrangement: An ecological sonic rhetoric of podcasting
  - a new medium does not replace old media or cause old media to disappear;
