        <p>In this webtext, we (nine Master of Arts degree-seeking students and their scatterbrained professor) share our exploration of the word cloud as a digital rhetoric artifact.</p>
        <p>Word clouds as a form of distant reading and network visualization have been offered up as potential entry points for newcomers to scholarly disciplines (Brooke, 2009; Mueller, 2017); this webtext describes our attempts to engage word clouds as such in a graduate survey course about digital rhetoric. Distant reading, introduced in 2000 by Franco Moretti, has been brought into writing studies and other fields to help address a growing realization of the increasing accessibility and resulting overabundance of texts available. The problem of too many texts means that navigating and making sense of text, data, and various knowledges and disciplinary discourses, and entering into those conversations, can be difficult for a novice (where to begin?), for someone trying to explore and construct scholarly identities in various knowledge practices, and imagine new avenues of research and integration. One method of distant reading is through the construction of visual models such as word clouds, which can allow novices trying to make some sense of the foreign terrains built in various discourse communities.</p>

        <p>With this thought in mind, the project students took on was to <a href="assignment.html">create word clouds of recent issues of scholarly journals related to digital rhetoric</a>. After creating distant readings, students reflected on, analyzed, and shared their clouds with the class (published as HTML pages as part of a larger profile/portfolio site project), inviting conversation both about what sorts of readings are possible through this medium as well as themes or patterns that provided a way into particular scholarly journals or a sense of topics and recent trends in digital rhetoric.</p>

        <p>Though we initially thought our webtext would evaluate word clouds as a pedagogical (?) tool to help introduce graduate students to the field of digital rhetoric via distant reading methods, ultimately this webtext discusses the value in visualizing networks, which allow us to build our own connections and interests as graduate students. What, ultimately, are some reasons for engaging in distant reading methods as graduate students--in particular as students in a generalist MA program?</p>
