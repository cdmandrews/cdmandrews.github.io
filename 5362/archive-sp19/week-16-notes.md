[Everyone's sites so far](fambly)

## To do for today:

Nicole's thing.

**Here's the [most current draft of our webtext](https://emireno.github.io/drclass/index.html)!**

You should have:   
  - **Worked out your reflection/discussion**
  - **Worked out your new word clouds and answers to OG questions:**
  - **Other tasks if assigned**

Tasks (unless I've left something out):
* **Oh yeah. Where do we put the author bylines or bios or "author" page?**
* Migrate reflection/discussion/word clouds into HTML templates
* Design
  - Check out vertical/horizontal layouts and other issues on the example.
  - Colors?
  - Graphics for borders?
  - Cloud sprite?
* Revision of main parts
  - Theory, intro, conclusions
  - Cloud for home page
  - Individual reflections & word clouds; make good titles and subheadings
  - Proofread **HTML** for errors (check for #profile nav problems on some subpages)
    * *if there's no padding (black space) around your pages' sprite, we need to fix the #profile nav.*
    * please use `<cite></cite>` for all book/journal titles; use `<em></em>` for other italics
  - Proofread **text** for errors (spelling, etc. Use past tense for author signal phrases when quoting/paraphrasing)
  - References. Comb through all reflections for all sources cited and build [Kairos house style](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/styleguide.html#apa) reference page
  - Do we *need* both versions of word clouds?
* **Define individual production roles and relationships as we head into the murk of "when the semester's over and we're moving on to other things."**


## To do for next time:

 * Have yourself a merry little Festivus. You are all hard-working and wonderful people and I'm incredibly glad we were able to share this class- and head-space this semester. You're only the second group of graduate students I've had the opportunity to teach/learn with, and each of you has made it personally and intellectually rewarding for me. I wish you the best in the awesome things upcoming!
