			<h2>Accessibility and Course Delivery</h2>
      <p>I work continually to ensure this course’s design, delivery, and policies are as radically <a href="https://webaim.org/" target="_blank">accessible</a> as I can make them. I am here to help you succeed. If you have questions or <a href="#ada">specific accessibility needs</a> that are not being met, I welcome dialogue with you.</p>
			<p>With COVID-19, we are living in a dynamic and uncertain situation—things seem to change every week. I’ll work on the basic assumptions of an ethics of care: We’re all people and deserve to be treated like people. Your well-being is important to me (and to this university). I will do what I can to be flexible and responsive to situations, and ask that you do the same. You should also <a href="https://www.tamucc.edu/campus-announcements/coronavirus-stay-at-home-resources.html">review the TAMU-CC list of Coronavirus resources and frequently asked questions</a></p>

			<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
			<p>Studies in the theory and practice of electronic research, writing and editing. Includes topics that relate to academic scholarship and contemporary writing instruction within electronic settings.</p>

			<h2>About the Course</h2>
			<p>Webtexts, broadly defined, are texts “authored specifically for publication on the World Wide Web”: they are hypertextual and multimodal. They wed rhetoric, design, and code to enact arguments and perform meaning. </p>
      <p>In this course, we’ll mix survey and workshop to explore both the whys and the hows of scholarly webtexts and digital publishing. We will read broadly in digital rhetoric scholarship and explore the relevance of that work for our pedagogical, professional, and personal practices. We will also add to your technical and rhetorical practices as we create accessible, rhetorical digital webtexts in a variety of media and on topics that you’ll develop expertise in.</p>
      <p>A spirit of tinkering and experimentation around both what we read and what we build will be at the heart of everything we’ll do. No particular technical expertise is prerequisite for the course: Beginners Welcome!</p>
      <p>This document is a <strong>preliminary syllabus</strong>&mdash;it needs your input. I have designated the general course topic, broad objectives the course, and the initial class schedule and assignments. And of course, standard University policy and procedure components of a syllabus are included.</p>
      <p>But you will also notice that other parts of the syllabus, including the particulars of course topics and details about how we will meet objectives, are not yet laid out. I invite you to help me finalize the particulars in accordance with the interests, aptitudes, and needs of the group as a collection of diverse, graduate-level learners. Over the first few weeks of the course, we will collaborate together on the sections tagged <strong>#preliminary</strong>&mdash;each person will have equal input&mdash;and we will “finalize” the syllabus at that time. </p>

      <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
      <p>In this course you will:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Develop skills in composing with attention to multiple and layered elements of digital writing conventions as you create rhetorical, digital, multimodal texts</li>
        <li>Develop perspectives and strategies for incorporating digital multimodal composition into your pedagogical and/or professional practices</li>
        <li>Advance your proficiency in scholarly methods of research and inquiry</li>
      </ol>

				<li>We will work with a variety of open tools as the class finds its own direction—a spirit of tinkering and figuring things out is a valuable required material. </li>
