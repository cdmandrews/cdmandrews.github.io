			<h2>Accessibility and Course Delivery</h2>
			<p>I work continually to ensure this course’s design, delivery, and policies are as radically <a href="https://webaim.org/" target="_blank">accessible</a> as I can make them. I am here to help you succeed. If you have questions or <a href="#ada">specific accessibility needs</a> that are not being met, I welcome dialogue with you. I work on the basic assumptions of an ethics of care: 1) We’re all people and deserve to be treated like people. 2) Your well-being is important to me. 3) I will do what I can to be flexible and responsive to situations, and ask that you do the same.</p>

			<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
			<p>Studies in the theory and practice of electronic research, writing and editing. Includes topics that relate to academic scholarship and contemporary writing instruction within electronic settings.</p>

			<h2>About the Course</h2>
			<p>Circulation. Distribution. Delivery. Collaboration. The fun, messy stuff that goes along with digital writing AFTER you hit the “publish” button. How does discourse circulate to achieve goals? Whose goals are met when discourse is put into motion? What happens when discourse is on the go?</p>
			<p>This course overviews digital rhetoric: an interdisciplinary field offering scholars, teachers, and makers an array of theories, methods, and practices for working with digital texts. We will survey scholarship in digital rhetoric and explore the relevance of that work for your pedagogical, professional, and personal writing practices. You will practice digital research methods to develop a research project on a topic of your choosing. You will also add to your technical and rhetorical skills to evaluate and compose accessible and usable digital texts in a variety of media and on topics that you’ll develop expertise in.</p>
			<p>A spirit of tinkering and experimentation around both what we read and what we build will be at the heart of everything we’ll do. No particular technical expertise is prerequisite for the course.</p>
