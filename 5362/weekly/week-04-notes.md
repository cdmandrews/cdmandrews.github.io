## (crash course in) APA Style

Citing sources is not simple or a matter of following directions. It's a matter of prior knowledge, understanding how arguments are made, what kinds of arguments are made, that there are directions that need to be followed and the nature of the choices that need to be made, and more... 

<blockquote>Writers choose texts to quote in order to connect themselves to particular traditions of thinking or researching; to put their arguments in the context of other, more prominent authors, whose views are already accepted by readers; or to put forth arguments or examples a writer wants to contest, examine, or elaborate. So, selecting and discussing sources is a matter of savvy diplomacy, persuasion, and argumentation. Sure, it involves learning how to follow detailed directions about how and where to place punctuation in order to indicate where quotations start and end; more importantly, it involves learning how and why writers associate themselves with sources, whether they seek to agree with what they’ve read, argue with what they’ve read, or apply what they’ve read to a new context. It involves understanding that there are reasons for using evidence other than to support a claim; writers might use sources to identify trends in order to argue with them. <br><br>Harrington, in <i>Bad Ieas about Writing</i></blockquote>

Where do citation systems come from? What is the purpose of a citation system? There's auseful discussion if you want to nerd out in Connors, R. J. (1999). [The rhetoric of citation systems, Part II: Competing epistemic values in citation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/466152). *Rhetoric Review 78.2

What do formatting differences in citation styles (as interfaces?) and stylistic differences in style manuals tell us about the cultures of the academic disciplines that use them? What do parentheical vs numerical citations show us about the values of the scholarly disciplines that use them?
