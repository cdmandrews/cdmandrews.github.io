## Notes and Questions for Update Culture: 

### Your questions from Part Two
1. Since “unethical” content does not automatically make a digital writer an unethical person, could unethical methods be used to achieve an ethical means? (E.g. “Whitehat” trolling, in an attempt to stop the circulation of blatantly false information)
1. Nearly every case mentioned within the text suggests that all the subjects interviewed contribute so heavily to update culture due to the “rush” or sense of validation that they receive from the interaction. Could it be argued that update culture thrives on exploitation?

### understanding Kairos, Chronos, and Digital Writing; What are writers doing as their writing is in circulation? 

How have roles for writers changed in 21st century writing contexts? How have the technologies with which we write, deliver, and circulate writing affected writing/writers? 
    - as digital writing circulates, it does not do so statically or without making a claim on those who initially write it (4)
    - fundamental shift in the analytic and inventive focus from an end product of writing to the emergent responses to online commenters (4)

How do the kinds of everyday writing and everyday writers Gallagher is writing about intersect with our lives? Do we engage in this kind of behavior? Which of our day-to-day pursuits depend on these types of writers/writing? 

we should examine not just the end product, but how processes and stratgies change over the course of time as they experience their audience's reactions and responses (after composed, during delivery) -- writing during circulation (which is different from print economies of writing)

    - "terminal points for writing have ceased" (p. 106)
    - online audiences pose new topoi and change doxa that beg for inventive possibilities and interactions
    - "circulatory writing processes" not just "texts in circulation" or "results of circulation" -- from mass reading/writing to mass editing/revision

writers attend to afterlife in "update culture" through stratiegies:
- textual timing
- textual attention
- textual management

Update culture is NOT radically new, just faster and more intense version of historical antecendents and precedents

<mark>What do we do with the expectation of textual mutability?</mark>

#### Mutability ["We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon"]
BY PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY

I.<br>
We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; <br>
How restlessly they speed and gleam and quiver,<br>
Streaking the darkness radiantly! yet soon<br>
Night closes round, and they are lost for ever:-—<br>
II.<br>
Or like forgotten lyres whose dissonant strings<br>
Give various response to each varying blast,<br>
To whose frail frame no second motion brings<br>
One mood or modulation like the last.<br>
III.<br>
We rest-—a dream  has power to poison sleep;<br>
We rise—-one wandering thought pollutes the day;<br>
We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep,<br>
Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:-—<br>
IV.<br>
It is the same!—-For, be it joy or sorrow,<br>
The path of its departure still is free;<br>
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;<br>
Nought may endure but Mutability.

### Interactive and Participatory Internet Templates (IPI)

- **how do templates operate as structures that provide *decorum* (also habits, expectations)**
- **how do templates "prefigure the writer/audience relationship" (p. 7)?**

<mark>IPI Templates defined</mark>: interactive interfaces of ongoing prefabricated designs and cultural forms; contain empty spaces designated for writing or filling in; surrounded by a variety of interactive fields (p 34)
 - web 2.0, but much more--site builders, 
 - no "document"
 - rhetoric/discourse flows rapidly and on a large scale, but not without structure
 - designed to move texts (etc) for the purpose of user-to-user communication

<mark>template rhetoric</mark> has four characteristics:
users communicate on the internet through interactive templates that structure the available means of persuasion; they can get creative with the interface and invent new ways of using the available means, but interactions are still structured (in interfaces) and behind it all is a lack of coding access
1. repetition (continuous filling in/out, continuous prodding, creation of habit)
1. time-space compression (tech increases speed of production, distribution, circulation; discourse quickly moves around; conflation of when with what/how)
1. ambient affordances (users & templates coalesce to form persuasive digital rhetoric beyond TD or SC; templates/techs have an active/primary role in situation/event of digital writing; habituated ways to respond and a common lnaguage for understanding response)
1. standardization (imposition of hegemonic communication practices; templates inform us about what kind of infor goes where; filters to expectation and decorum)

- templates are interactive interfaces (aimed at producing "invisible" interface or transparent medium--goal of easy, fast, immediate)
- templates prod users to fill out empty fields, "ongoing prefabricated designs" (37); discourse is structurted and habitual/predictable--types of interactivity are standardized
- cultural forms emerge when IPI templates habituate us to act in certain ways, persuading us through repetition (like/subscribe, friend, status, etc)

### textual timing: kairos and chronos

- <mark>kairos</mark>: rhetoric's time; fitness based on when/context; embodied and immanent, but not evaluatable until after its passing; "the opportune moment"
- <mark>chronos</mark>: clock's time; monitoring and observing patterns of time
- Gallagher argues that pairing chronos and kairos helps us understand digital writers' timing strategies--how they qualitatively learned when appropriate moments to write and respond were and how they translated that into quantitative perspectives
- **writers need a framework that allows them to approach rhetorical situations and ecologies in a coherent and organized fashion** (see problems with always on, stopping/not stopping, pandering ad populum, info overload, going viral) (p. 56)
    - **kairos-chronos fusion**: pacing and patterning
    - **template timing**: first, recent, default display (good timing as manifested in space as well as time--the screen)
    - **algorithmic timing**: understanding timing in relation to blackboxed elements distilled into a platform's display and interface; planning for how algorithms aggregate audience (response)

### textual attention: responding to audiences

- reading, filtering, and eavesdropping (Ratcliffe 2006, *Rhetorical Listening*)
- discursive actions writers digital writers employ when giving attention to audiences; **conceptualizing and responding to a participatory audience**
- *why does Gallagher use "attention" instead of "listening" or just "reading" for his trope in this chapter?* (p. 78)
- "a way of reading multiple audience members' reactions within a written digital environment with the express aim of responding to some--but not all--comments"; determining the **value** of various types of participation. How do we determine what to pay attention to? 
- reflexive attention--"I give my attention to what I value and I value what I give my attention to." (Citton qtd in p. 82); the "right kind" (?) of attention
- three parts of textual attention:
    - success / **concatenation of public voices**
    - **search for sincerity** - developing categories to ignore, etc; see management; sincere/genuine as inverse propertyr
    - **recognition of sincerity**

### textual management: writing and agency/control

- actions writiers deploy to enact agency/control over their writing
- **how and why is managing audiences "integral" to 21st century writing?**
- identifying digital hivemind/groupthink (p 107 ff)
    - how is what Gallagher discusses here in conversation with [scholarship about audience addressed/audience invoked and audience/writer boundaries](week-03-notes)?
- textual management strategies, which encompass editorial activities and curatorial practices as well as "impression management":
    - **macromanagement**, including internal frames and external frames (official and unofficial)
    - **indirect management**, monitor, curate, control as indirect modes of responding to audiences
    - **direct management**, dealing with trolls directly
    - **responsive management**, ignore, delete, correct, updating--and engaging in **versioning** of content and the expectation of mutability
- aspirational branding

### ethics in the age of update culture
- what are the effects/costs of update culture?  how do they coalesce around economics and labor issues?
- in what sense are timing, attention, and management coping mechanisms for the costs of update culture?
- what is the role of virtue ethics and a **normative, contingent ethical framework** for digital writing? (p. 140)
- what is your experience with Gallagher's three habits/**digital communication virtues** for writers in the context of digital/21st century writing? 
    - **consistency**
    - **persistence**
    - **patience**
    - digital communication virtues: communication practices digital writers use to contend with various types of information communication technologies (ICTs) (p. 145ff) -- contending with and resisting emerging habits of platforms (templates and affordances); habits that help writers develop standards, not standards themselves. 

## For Next Time (for Oct 19 )

For the next three weeks we're working together through Gries & Brooke (Eds.) (2018). *Circulation, Writing, and Rhetoric*. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt21668mb](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt21668mb) You will read selectively, rather than the entire book, and between all of us, we will be able to have multiple readings of the core issues in the text. I will invite three volunteers to help lead discussion on each of those days by working through their talking points with the class. 

Everyone will prepare talking points and post them for your reading journal entry that week, either as a Word doc or pdf file attached to your journal entry. This [handout](media/preparing-talking-ooints.docx) discusses tips for preparing your talking points.
