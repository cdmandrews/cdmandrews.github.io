# Notes and Overview for Week 01

[ENGL 5362, Fall 2023](/5362/calendar.html)

<span style="color:red;">*Important: No assignments or course documents, including the syllabus, should be considered to be in their final form until the first week of class begins.*</span>

Each week, I'll post notes and an overview of the week's content (just like this document). These docs will detail specific readings, assignments, and due dates for each week. In general, when people email me about being confused about what to do that week, I will ask them: "Did you check the overview?" Always check these weekly documents first!

## Agenda
1. Introduce each other and compose ourselves
2. Questions about the syllabus and [Blackboard](https://bb9.tamucc.edu) ever so briefly
3. Talk about this week's readings and probably what we already know about rhetorick
4. Look at the [Online presence project](/5362/project-1.md)
5. Talk about what it means to "Read like a grad student" in all of its deceptive simplicity

## Form/Content and Rhetoric 
*Assigned readings can always be found on Blackboard. Addional resources should be there, and if not are accessible through our Library)*

You were to have read the following today:
- Richard Lanham (1989), "The Electronic Word: Literary Study and the Digital Revolution" 
- Lisa Dush (2015), "When Writing Becomes Content"
- James Porter (2009), "Recovering Delivery for Digital Rhetoric"
- Beatrice Warde (1932), "The Crystal Goblet"

Without being game-the-system-ish about it, why did I put these together? Most of them don't even cite about each other and may not recognizeably be about the same things if you asked most readers. 

What does form/content and rhetoric have to do with it?


Works I'll mention or that might help with additional background on today's topics:
- Douglas Eyman (2015), [*Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice*](https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/qn59q490d) <mark>This could be a supplemental textbook for the course; Eyman aims at a synthesis and overview of digital rhetoric theory and situates that theory in a variety of methods and practices that reach across the fields of composition, rhetoric, computers and writing, and technical communication</mark>
- Roland Barthes (1964), "Rhetoric of the Image"
- James P. Zappen (2005), "Digital Rhetoric: An Integrated Theory"
- Kathleen Blake Yancey (2004), "Made Not Only in Words: Composition in a New Key"
- Johndan Johnson-Eilola (2012), "[Polymorphous Possibility and Texts](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/16.3/topoi/johnson-eilola/)"

## Notes/Questions for readings

what is "digital rhetoric"? 
- simple definition is **the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances** (Eyman, 2015, p. 12)
- Eyman immediately notes that the terms *rhetoric* and *digital text* (and *digital* and *text*) are immediately complex--what constitutes a digital text? how do you define rhetoric?
- a couple of theory tracks in digital rhetoric (see Eyman chapter 2 for exmaples of each)
    - some start with classical & contemporary rhetorical theory (i.e. Aristotle to the 1900s) and applies that theory to digital texts/contexts
    - others argue that digital networked communication requires a rearticulation of said theories
        - for example, Colin Brooke's work of updating Aristotelian/Ciceronian formulation of the canons
        - for example, work to apply the rhettorical situation as a useful lens for analysis and production (we'll look at this work quite a bit in this course)  
    - others suggest new rhetorical theory altogether is necessary

primary activities of digital rhetoric (according to Eyman) include:
- the use of rhetorical strategies in production and analysis of digital text
- identifying characteristics, affordances, and constraints of new media
- formation of digital identities
- potential for building social communities (
- inquiry and development of rhetorics of technology
- the use of rhetorical methods for uncovering and interrogating ideologies and cultural formation in digital work
- an examination of the rhetorical function of networks
- theorization of agency when interlocutors are as likely to be software agents as they are human actors

field mapping: where are we in here?

### Questions from you-all

1. The first article (Lanham) talks about the “transparency” of the alphabet (266) and the last reading (Warde) talks about achieving the “transparent page” (4). Could we discuss as a class the ways in which we think digital forms/spaces help us achieve this desired “transparency” or if they do help us?
2. In the third article (Porter) he mentions that the five components “prompt rhetorical decisions regarding production” or that they “help us write” (208). I was thinking of the 5 Knowledge Domains (Beaufort) and how they might interact with/fit under the rhetorical knowledge domain. It got me thinking about how we have to reconsider the rhetorical domain for digital forms/spaces. What other parts of the writing process do we need to look at or reconsider when dealing with the digital form? All of them?
1. Does this complication of content [from Dush] affect all writings? For instance, is there less of a need to consider assets when publishing children’s books due to the simple nature of the book or would there be more to consider specifically because of the audience?
1. With writing becoming more of a content that can be dissected and repurposed, do you think that plagiarism would become stricter with its use or would it ease up under the umbrella of ‘repurposed content.’
1.	What in the sweet Sam hell is a codex book? I didn’t realize until about halfway through the selection that it was written in 1985, a year after I was born! I’m going with that’s why I don’t comprende “codex book.” I also didn’t see anywhere where it stated what exactly it was. I googled and the just of what I got was they are essentially printed books. They just gave it a fancy name. Is that accurate? 
2.	In “The Electronic Word: Literary Study and the Digital Revolution”, they mention that textbooks are going to have to decide if they are going to be in the business of information or textbooks. This was written in 1985. Do you think they have decided on the business of information or textbooks all these years later? (I would like a fellow teacher and student perspective on this question.) 
4.	“Recovering Delivery for Digital Rhetoric” was written in 2009. In this article, they discuss how we have serious accessibility issues that need to be addressed as we move towards primarily publishing public information online. Do you believe this accessibility issue still holds true today?  


### Lanham, "The Electronic Word: Literary Study and the Digital Revolution"
- of note is Lanham's big optimism and revolutionary rhetoric (he's more than a a bit of a determinist, if a joyful one)
- pub in the 80s, well before the internet (which was around, let's not get crazy) would even more upset the applecart--this is the age of the CD-ROM, the rise of the personal computer
- but how much of this applies today?
- key bits and phrases
    - digitization desubstantiating
    - unselfconscious transparency / basic stylistic decorum / the fixed text (p. 266)
        - related concepts from Bolter & Grusin (2000), *Remediation*: [remediation, immediacy, mediation, hypermediacy](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/6.1/reviews/blakesley/glossary.html#remediation)
        - see Warde (1932) here, "The Crystal Goblet" - "no cloud must come between your eyes and the fiery heart of the liquid." 
            - Warde is the touchstone for concepts of clarity (in typography and design) and straightforward presentation of content.
            - what is/should be the relation of thought to form?
            - Ironically (?) many of Warde's early publications in typography were published under the pseudonym Paul Beaujon, who she imagined as "a man of long grey beard, four grandchildren, a great interest in antique furniture and a rather vague address in Montparnasse" (thanks Wikipedia!)
    - creator-controlled and reader-controlled; the interactive reader of the electronic word (p. 268)
    - the textual surface has become permanently bistable; AT / THROUGH oscillation (oscillatio) (p. 267)
        - see unselfconscious/self-conscious bistable decorum (p. 276)
        - the Greek philosophers championed the first view, the Sophists the second, and we have been debating the issue ever since (p. 277)
    - **what business are we really in? (p. 270; 285ff)**
    - digitization both desubstantiates a work of art and subjects it to perpetual immanent metaphorphosis from one sense dimension to another (p. 273)
    - the Ovidian metamorphosis looks backward as well as forward (p. 275)
    - Rhetoric... a general theory for [all the arts](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~traister/lanham.html) (p. 278)
    - fundamental questions to rethink
        - copyright and the struggle between freedom to publish and profit and state control
        - profits and duplication/distribution?
        - intellectual property and final cut and fair use?
        - traditional (academic) merit badges and value of text/delivery/system?
        - what publication means
        - tranditional figure of humanist as Luddite vs computer as A Possible Friend
        - new students
        - what does "Majoring in English" mean?
        - the rhetorical [paideia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paideia) (p. 286)
        - Western Self and allowing neither Arnoldian Sincerity nor Deconstructive Despair
    - "If we decide once again to view technology with a hostile eye, this time we may find ourselves making the pianos while someone else makes the music." (p. 288)

### Dush, "When Writing Becomes Content"
- four characteristics of content. content is: 
    - **conditional**: fluidity in what shape it may take and where it may travel, intdeterminacy in terms of who uses, for what, and how valued
    - **computable**: subject to algorithmic manipulation (mine, rank, process, match, reconfigure, redistribute,)(Manovich (2001) *Language of New Media* principles: numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability, cultural transcoding)
    - **networked**: hooked into networks of human and nonhuman actors, mutliple, discursive, material, (unknowable?)
    - **commodified**: will be/"is always already" visible to market evaluation (use value & exchange value--value is when text is in circulation)
- what does "content" highlight about composing that "digital writing" or "multimodal" do not?
    - "text transformed into data"; again see Manovich and Dush's four characteristics
    - highlights the fundamental social and material practice/nature of writing (studies)
- why is "content" (potentially) a necessary metaphor to pair with "writing"
    - metaphors are not neutral, and can bundle to foreclose possibilities (literacy--tech literacy--multiliteracy--computer literacy--digital literacy)
    - content metaphor helpfully focuses us beyond the designed document
    - see table of oppositions, Figure 2 p. 182; the entities, contexts, practices, characterizations of content and writing are.... different, some  harder to reconcile
    - **what is the danger of missing the writing-as-content metaphor?**
    - **what are potential consequences of writing-as-content realities?**
- how is "content" changing professions/work/fields? opportunities? responsibilities? values? 
    - comes out of TC and (digital) marketing/publishing
    - can writing-as-a-craft weather commidification? how is this bound up with gig economy, efficiency/ease/profit logics of high capitalism, and always-on edge workplaces?
    - content management & content management systems, content professions, 
    - structured authoring, single-sourcing, asset management, strict separation of form and content, content repurposing
- becoming: 1) growth, merging, old thing *is also* the new thing. 2) transformation (metamorphosis?), old thing *has now become* a new thing

<mark>(reading note--the level one of this outline above are just my notes/transformations of the intro--I could now read the full article and sit down and try to answer the questions or flesh out notes in summary, as I have here in the nested parts of the list)</mark>

### Porter, "Recovering Delivery for Digital Rhetoric"
- resuscitating delivery -- we need a robust theory of delivery to help us navigate rhetorical complexities of the options and implications in front of us -- and need to think about production, design, reception, circulation of writing
- classical canons of the art of rhetoric:
    - invention
    - arrangement
    - style
    - memory
    - delivery
- Porter's theoretical framework (*koinoi topoi*, common topics) for digital delivery:
    - **body/identity**: concerning online representations of the body, gestures, voice, dress, and image, and questions of identity and performance and online representations of race, class, gender, sxual orientation, and ethnicity
    - **distribution/circulation**: concerning the technological publishing options for reproducing, distributing, and circulating digital information
    - **access/accessibility**: concerning questions about audience connectedness to Internet-based information
    - **interaction/interactivity**: concerning the range and types of engagement (between people, between people and information) encouraged or allowed by digital designs
    - **economics**: concerning copyright, ownership, and control of information, fiar use, authorship, and all the politics of information policy
- rhetoric as techne - craft/art making-knowledge, form and effect and result, abstract and procedural

## Reading like a grad student: a time to read and a time to skim
An important academic skill is learning how to read different things differently. As research people (this is one of the whole points of graduate study in English), you need to be able to find and process lots of information and sources. And you need to develop a keen sense for understanding relevance and goals for different types of ifnormation so you can know when to read deeply and when to read quickly.

You may have been told in the past not to skim. Those people were wrong. There is a time (now) and a place (here). If you only read what you read in great depth, you will 1) have less breadth of knowledge and 2) quickly become ovoerwhelmed by how much there is to read and how much you haven't read, and then 3) not read stuff at all because of anxiety.

Nobody reads an academic article (or chapter) effectively one time through. You engage with it several times and in different ways--quick up first, slower later.

</div>

Why to skim:
- you have to read a lot and for a variety of purposes; it's your job, and you should be able to do it effieciently and effectively
- to have a general idea of what kinds of research is being done about X
- to sift through lots of stuff quickly in order to find the small quantity of stuff you need to read more closely
- to stay out of the reading death spiral. There is always something else to read, and that can crush us and keep us from writing. 

Reading strategies:

1) understand what different genres are, why they are written
    - primary sources: might be literrary works, rhetorical artifacts, texts, or qualitative/quantitative data
    - theory: provides philosophical or methodological approach to an issue or phenomenon
    - original research: criticism, empirical studies, problem-solution articles, disciplinary overviews
        - in rhetoric/writing studies fields, you commonly bump into either "scholarly analysis" (aka criticism or a reading) or empirical studies (with methods, results, etc.)
    - literature review: organizes and surveys what key scholarship has been written on a specialized topic 
    - book review/review article: summarizes and makes claims about the quality of other published works
    - practical or how-to: instruction for how to use or apply a theory, method, or practice (often pedagogy in writing studies)
2) understand your purpose for reading or your professor's purpose for assigning a reading
    - are you identifying? analyzing? comparing? evaluating? responding? 
    - are you getting the basic sense or knowledge of a new field or topic?
    - are you planning a simmilar study?
    - are you organizing materials to select what to read later?
    - are you reading to get research ideas or investigate a topic for a paper yor project you have to write?
    - are you reading to collect lines of argument or evidence, to support or critique an argument?
3) adopt a system for note-taking and reference management
    - reference management software such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide), [Mendeley], etc. Install add-ons or plugins for your browser to make collecting and organizing citations easy; can integrate with your word processor and create Reference Lists quickly for editing and polishing.  (We'll look at reference management in the future if you have never done so)
    - write notes in a document or in your ref mgmt software (or even a notebook), the absolute worst way to take ntoes is by annotating PDFs and you should never do it. "collect notes, not articles"
    - note taking should be sustainable and standardized a bit, but not too system-y or cryptic of a system
    - note taking shouldn' tbe too insider-y, imagine you are writing notes for someone else who needs to decide whether the text is worth their time (i.e., yourself ten years from now)
3) layered or intentional reading
    - skimming: getting the gist: going through titles and abstracts only to decide what might be relevant and pack it away. used with keyword searches and reference/citation searches (more on that later) to find things without reading yet.
    - scanning. Hop to what you need and read just that; searching a document to answer a question relying on textual cues and keywords.
    - close reading: in-depth investigation of specific parts/elements of a text or the whole; carefully read the whole for comprehension. When you need to understand an argument or are looking at primary sources for evidence, you're probably close reading
4) hyper-reading, or "computer-assisted human reading" and Machine reading/Distant reading (human-assisted computer reading) (Sosnoski, 1999; Tham & Grace, 2020)


AIC Method of Reading is good for a **first read** of anything

1) read the abstract if there is one
2) read the introduction (section, paragraph, or chapter if it's a book)
3) read the conclusion (section, paragraph, or chapter)
4) read the first sentence of body paragraphs or first paragraphs of sections (or subheadings if the article has meaningful subheadings); Remember high school--topic sentences are indeed your friend.

* Attend to keywords: if there are words you don't know in the title, intro, subheadings, and topic sentences, you should stop and look them up in a discipline-appropriate source

* Attend to graphics, figures, and tables--they are there because they're so important they need visual support/explanation

After reading: 

1) try to summarize the main ideas and support or details of what you read before you dive in to particular points
2) reflect on how this thing connects to class discussions, your experiences, other examples
3) evaluate the merits and weaknesses of what you've read

Tips:

- AICing before you read the whole thing improves retention and you will know when/where to skim parts later
- Monitor comprehension and take breaks.
- Don't read academic articles in bed; pay attention to when and where and how you focus appropriately
- Know you can come back and read them later. I have been re-reading Lanham articles since the early 00s, it's okay.

## For Next Time

### Journal entry for week 2
Write a short (300ish+ words) digital literacy autobiography for your next journal entry.  (Also, include a handful of questions based on/out of our readings, which are all about interfaces and ideology.)

Write about a technology that has affected your skills, abilities, and/or experiences as a writer and/or as a reader. This is not a research paper. This assignment is an autobiography—-a piece in which you tell a story about yourself as a writer and/or as a reader, specifically a story about how technology has changed your approaches to writing or to reading. Don't feel like you have to tell a full autobiographical narrative; this could just as well be a scene, a sketch, or a series of brief anecdotes.

You might write about:
- what you have learned about grammar from playing video games
- how composing on a computer has changed your approaches to writing
- how designing graphics on a computer has changed your ideas about what composing is and how words and images work together
- how you don’t consider texting to be writing

*These are only examples—choose any narrative thread you wish to unfold your autobiography.*

Potentially helpful invention points:
- What were your earliest experiences with a writing technology? With a digital writing technology? What do you remember about them? How did you use them? What did you write/create?
- How has your writing changed with or in relationship to digital writing technologies?
- What does your current digital writing environment look like? The physical environment—computer, desk, surrounding area; the virtual environment—the desktop, screens, and interfaces you write within? How does this environment reflect your digital writing practices?
- What digital tools do you currently use to write, compose, and/or create? What sorts of “texts” do you produce? How are the texts you produce different because they were created digitally?
- What would your writing be like if you did not have access to digital writing tools?
