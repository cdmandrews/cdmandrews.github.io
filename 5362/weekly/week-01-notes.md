# Notes and Overview for Week 01

[ENGL 5362, Fall 2023](/5362/calendar.html)

<span style="color:red;">*Important: No assignments or course documents, including the syllabus, should be considered to be in their final form until the first week of class begins.*</span>

Each week, I'll post notes and an overview of the week's content (just like this document). These docs will detail specific readings, assignments, and due dates for each week. In general, when people email me about being confused about what to do that week, I will ask them: "Did you check the overview?" Always check these weekly documents first!
