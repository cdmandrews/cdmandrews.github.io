![What is an interface](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/What-is-an-interface-in-Java-interface-in-Java.png)

1. What is an interface and how has writing studies theorized interfaces? How do interfaces inscribe ideology? 
interface: a primary representation of a computer system or program; a "cultural map" of a computer system (Selfe & Selfe p. 485)

    - Colin Brooke, in *Lingua Fracta* (2009, the almost textbook of this course) locates the interface as the most important site for us to look at in rhet tech/newmedia--we must look at the interface and not the individual text
    - the point of contact between two elements that interact (Jones, 2021), may be computational (as in GUIs) or printed texts and physical or digital objects 
    - a means or place of interaction (Carnegie p. 165), but a complex/contested concept--facilitates and (pre)defines interaction both concrete and abstract
        - page as interface
        - computer as interface
        - screen as interface
        - specific sites/apps/softwares as interfaces
        - physical objects we interact with; symbolic components of GUIs, cognitive and emotional aspects
    - just as we learn to read geographical information in maps through certain koinoi topoi and stereotyped images/styles,
    - just as goegraphical maps purport to represent fact, they naturalize political and ideological interests of the authors
        - as they naturalize, maps include and omit 
    - **affordances**: properties that enable users to do something and reflect possible relationships; suggest appropriate usage
        - physical, what you can do; 
        - percieved, what you undersand you can do
        - sensory, functional, cognitive
    
2. What does it mean to look AT the interface rather than THROUGH? (back to Lanham, bistable oscillation); popular approaches to UI talk about interface invisibility (think back to Warde, also Krug, *Don't Make Me Think*). That is, how can we learn to be critical users of interfaces, and what questions do we need to ask to interrogate an interface? 
    - (See also Monea, [Screen Reading: A Gallery of (Re)imagined Interfaces](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/24.2/disputatio/monea/index.html); Monea de-familiarizes interfaces in order to sponsor critical interface literay (calling attention to “material, infrastructural, tangible, and aesthetic components of web design”) that is, making the “transparency of the interface” opaque.)

<mark>Interface activity</mark>: Log in to ChatGPT, create an account and fiddle around. What does the interface for ChatGPT primarily represent? What actions are encouraged and possible? What metaphors are bundled into the interface? What is the "cultural map" here? What is shown? What is obscured through the "generating text in order" component of the interface? What do LLMs do? (it seems from the interface that 'next word prediction' is a main one--but LLMS do more than that)

How can we talk about interfaces so we can see rhetorical implications of interfaces? (Carnegie, p. 166 and see questions on 172) How to exaxmine an interface 101, from Carnegie:
- **multidirectionality**
    - does the interface enable users to act as both reciever and sender?
    - to what extent is each of these roles facilitated, limited, or constrained?
    - are there exceptions (explicit or implict) and/or restrictions regarding who can participate?
    - how interactive is the exchange?
    - can the user refer back to other messages and participate in real dialogue?
    - is this practice encouraged or discouraged? how and why?
- **interactivity**
    - can the user change the interface? 
    - what choices are offered to the user?
    - to what degree do choices enable users to tailor the interface to their needs and interests?
    - how are users' choices limited?
    - who determines what choices are avialable?
    - what interests do the choices reflect?
    - can the user manipulate and create content? 
    - what constrains and limits the user's ability to do so?
    - what technologies, skills, and knowledge woudl the user need to manipulate or create content? 
- **presence**
    - is the user given knowledge of other participatns?
    how much time flexibility does the user have to create and send messages and thereby build connections with others?
    - does the interface provide visual and audio information about other users? if so, what are their backgroudns and characteristics?
    - does the interface itself have a character or agency? to whom would this character or agency appeal?
    - what schemas are being invoked by the interface?
    - what cultural, political, economic backgrounds and interests do these schemas reflect?
    - who would be familiar with the schemas needed to interact with the interface?
    - who would be exclued?
    - how accurately does the interface map to user's experience and potential responses?
    - how reflexive is the interface?
    - does the interface enable the user to map and follow alternate paths?
    - is the user asked to remain within a given schema or can he or she draw from other schemas and his or her own knowledge? 

What questions can we ask in a critical interface analysis? (Sano-Francini, 2018); questions about the meaning making function of an interface/site:
- Who is the target/primary user? Who are the secondary users, unintended users, and other stakeholders?
- What are the tasks, interactions, and relationships (human-computer, human-human) that are facilitated by and through the interface?
- What kinds of content are presented through the interface?
- What are the organizing logics of the interface?
- What are the ideological and cultural values and assumptions imparted through the interface, whether through its content, its organizing logics, or the interactions facilitated by the site?
- In what kinds of environments will these tasks be conducted and these interactions take place?
- What are the various affordances of the interface? Who benefits from its use and how do they benefit? What are the limitations of the interface? What and whom does it leave out?
- What are the range of emotions and embodied responses that are enabled and encouraged by the interface?
- On what memories, literacies, and histories does the interface rely?

What questions can we ask to explore how power is embedded in circulatory interfaces? How can we create more equitable ones? (from Jones, 2021)
- **producing prosumers**
    - what pre-written content does the interface make normative?
    - even if convenient, do normative circulatory actions reinstantiate data surveillance and prosumerism?
    - if so, what alternative options can designers offer to circulators?
- **creating culpability**
    - are all of the affordances to change design elements on the normative content clearly labelled to give circulators as much agency as possible?
    - do normative materials create culpability for one co-author while giving credit to another in the chain of circulation? if so, how do they accomplish that and is there a way to more equitably acknowledge labor and responsibility?
    - what types of relationships do interfaces make normative beetween website creators and potential circulators, and how do those relationships maintain or disrupt the status quo?
- **hashtag hailing**
    - if hashtags are "interpellating slogans" that build collectives, what hashtags can designers include on their interaces that may participate in building equitable colelctives?
    - if a digital interface uses a hashtag, what are the other ideological discourses attached to that hashtag?
    - are those adjacent conversations equitable?
    - what other elements of circulatory interfaces draw users into adjacent social and ideological positions?
- **relegating relationality**
    - what kinds of relationships and power dynamics will secondary interfaces create as they circulate in the world?
    - what types of sjubjects will secondary interfaces interpellate as they circulate?
    - how can designers include important background information about normative content? 

### Transduction and new media / rhetoric

1. WTH is "transduction"?

Bolter & Grusin (2000), *Remediation* ([all definitions are from this book review](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/6.1/reviews/blakesley/glossary.html#remediation))
- **mediation**: representation of an object; object of contemplation is structured and presented by some intervening medium; *the symbolic act itself* 
- **remediation**: the process whereby new media define themselves by borrowing from and refashioning other media; *anxiety of influence?*; remediation works in multiple directions (we might say it's transductive?) 
- **immediacy**: perfection/erasure of the gap between signifier and signified; the representation is percieved to be the thing itself; the symbol is the real; forgetting the presence of the medium (see Lanham, unselfconscious transparency; Warde's crystal goblet) 
- **hypermediacy**: style of visual representation whose goal is to remind the viewer of the medium; hyper-conscous of the act of seeing/gazing

### Selfe & Selfe (1994), The Politics of the Interface 
the "political and ideological boundary lands associated with computer interfaces" (p. 481)
- the ways these borders are at least partly constructed along ideological axes that represent dominan tendencies in our culture
- the ways in wich the borders... can be mapped as complex political landscapes
- the ways in wihich the borders can serve to prevent the circulations of individuals for political purposes
- the ways in which teachers and students can learn to see and alter such borders in productive ways
- tactics teachers cna use to enact a radical pedagogy of electronic borders and borderlands

computer interfaces as "linguisitc contact zones": social spaces where cultures meet/clas/grapple, contexts of highly asymmetrical relations of power as they are lived out in "interested version(s) of reality"

computer interfaces as maps that enact colonialism
- Selfe & Selfe frame their exigence as pushing back against overly positive (and positivisitic?) **rhetorics of technology** as a utopian revolutionary democratic social-cultural force

How does the basic Windows/Mac interface present reality as framed in the perspective of
- modern capitalism, 
- class privilege,
- discursive privilege of "standard English",
- rationalism and lgocentrism

bricolage and the computer? (p. 493)

the greatest difficulty "we must locate ourselves in relation to the map" (p. 495ff)

### Boyle, Brown & Ceraso (2018), The Digital: Rhetoric Behind and Beyond the Screen 
the digital as immersive, proliferating condition--it is never one thing 

1. conflation (dependency) of early digital rhetoric and visual modes of practice
2. multisensory rhetorical engagements
2. digital realized less visibly, through code, algorithm, infrastructure
- **transduction** and engaging digital rhetorically as an "ambient condition" (p. 252)

screen ("the screenic surface" or screen-based conventions) as the ur-interface for digital/nondigital theorizing of digital rhetoric--that is, the visual has been the primary logic or starting point of digital rhetoric? note how Welch poshed beyond screens into oral/aural features of electric rhetoric

"the digital is always multisensory (p. 254) (visual but also haptic and sonic and environmental)

Boyle, Brown, and Ceraso provide a useful review of scholarship that pushes beyond the screen--any of these pieces would be useful starting points for further study in particular areas:

- brooke (mutually transformative digital-rhetorical theory)
- warnick, rhetoric online (medium-specific dimensions of screen-based texts)
- losh, virtualpolitck (push into theories based in math/engineering)
- bogost, persasive games (procedural rhetoric)
- maher, "computational phronesis" of artificial agents
- banks, "digital griot" (technical skills, building communities and moving the crowd, nonwhite technorhetorics)
- queer worldmaking in digital spaces and untold histories
- adapting digital spaces to cultural practices
- database-driven digital rhetoric, network rhetoric
- inventional media

transduction: how a signal moves across disparate registers of rleations (p. 257), neither deductive nor inductive; converting energy or message into another form, each relay in a pathway changing the next molecule in the pathway

**rhetoric as a transductive process**

### Carnegie (2009), Interface as exordium
- the interface is exordium--engaes users and disposes them to persuasion (action?)
    - exordium, the beginning/intro of a discourse/composition--gets everyone all warmed up for persuasion (Cicero: 'well-disposed, attentive, and receptive').
- see interfaces as designed, as designs of human experience, as locus of power, enabling and disabling

the interface is the intro, not the intro.

rhetoric of the interface--that is, the **rhetorical modes of the interface** 

 - causing <mark>interactivity</mark> through three primary modes: 
    - <mark>multi-directionality:</mark> **permitted roles of the user in the network & referential/intertextual nature of messages** (not just hypertextuality, and variability, but also multi-roles (not just recievers), relatedness of messages/intertexutal dialogues) 
    - <mark>manipulability :</mark>**degree to which users can influence or manipulate form/content of communincation** (media dematerialized into numerical code and subjected to algorithmic manipulation which can be automated, reconfigured, customized--contained customization) 
    - <mark>presence:</mark> **degree to which users can feel copresent** (system attributes that create in users the experience of social and spatial presence) 

### Jones (2021), Circulatory interfaces: Perpetuating power through practices, content, and positionality

interfaces create normative circulatory practices, content, and positions; produce norms about who circulates what infromation and how

interfaces are productive because they interpellate subjects **interprellation**--understanding one's self to be part of a particular subject position by being "hailed" into that position. (we are invited/hailed into particular subject positions) 

**circulation is texts moving through time and space**

**circulation is world-making**--publics are called into existency by discourse, people imagine themselves as part of a group by being interpollated/hailed by texts; happens through circulation 

### Sano-Francini (2018), Designing Outrage, Programming Discord: A Critical Interface Analysis of Facebook as a Campaign Technology

Focus on microinteractions as a way to look at the ethic or priorities in interfaces. Facebook's UI prioritizes concicion, speed, curation practices that limit divergent perspectives, and the flattening of complex identities and political commitments such that they are indexable, processable, and thus, monetizable. Browsing, reacting, commenting, posting play a significant role in how design creates mediated intimacies.


### Haas (2007), Wampum as Hypertext

Wampum belts as interfaces

Wampum belts as hypertexts (creation of a structure of elements and their presentation in interaction with the reader)

Wampum belts as shared responsiblity

"In order to retrieve the encoded communication, an individual must be a part of the community with the cultural context for accurate retrieval of that information."

Wampum belts as indigenous revision of visual rhetorical/hypertextual sovereignty.

Both wampum and Western hypertexts supplement memory--communal, cultural, civic
