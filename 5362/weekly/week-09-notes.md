## Notes and Questions for *CWR* (Part 2 response chapters)

### Your questions and talking points
1. Volunteers created the following talking points:
    - [Cheyenne's talking points]
    - [Cameron's talking points]
    - [Tristan's talking points]
    - [Kelly's talking points]

## For Next Time (Nov 2)
Read the Afterword to *Circulation, Writing, and Rhetoric*: "The Futurity of Circulation Studies"

For your reading journal entry, complete the following:
1. Create talking points for the Afterword as per usual.
2. Additionally, referring back to this chapter (and any other text from the collection), brainstorm/develop 3 different ideas for possible future studies of circulation that you would be interested in. These could have a traditional academic/scholarly focus, or might be more practical, community- or workplace-oriented. Write at least a sentence about each of the following:
    - What site/text would you analyze?
    - What research or critique questions would you focus on?
    - What methods or ways of answering those questions would you adopt?
    - What important concepts (beyond "circulation" and "digital rhetoric" in the broad sense) might you employ or draw on in such a study? 

You may certainly draw on a preexisting project (a thesis proposal, the annotated bib or another project from this class, etc.) in developing one or more of your 3 ideas.

Post before class, etc., as usual. 

### For Nov. 9, Memes and circulation
Complete the "memeblog" activity (look in the "blogs" section in Blackboard) before coming to class on Thursday evening. Post memes and browse through other folks' posts. I'll have discussion questions and activities for class time inviting us to think about memes as praxis.
