# Project 3" Digital project

Extend the work in your annotated bibliography and research by making a **digital, multimodal project that uses digital rhetoric as an organizing and interpretive principle**. Your project might be: 

- an expressive digital object that enacts the theories and frameworks we have studied, 

- an extended research and critical analysis of the localized digital writing practice and/or culture from your annotated bibliography (considering human subjects research rules or permissions), 

- a critical interface analysis of the interfaces or IPI templates of your choice, working from concepts in our course readings to develop a framework for analysis that is mindful of circulation, distribution, and delivery as core components of rhetorical ecologies, 

- an analysis in which you explore questions developed out of the theories and frameworks we have studied, 

- a project growing out of lines of inquiry inspired across multiple courses this semester (e.g. extending work you’re doing in Dr. F-D’s Online Language course) 

You might create a digital map or timeline, curate a digital archive, draft a proposal and IRB for a larger study, code a short video game, write a digital poetry exhibition or interactive piece of fiction, create a scholarly webtext, and so forth.  

Expressive projects must be accompanied by a statement of goals and choices that contextualize the product in terms of course goals and the student’s literature review.
