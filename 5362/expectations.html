			<h2>On Expectations</h2>
		
			<p>Graduate school is weird. Master's degrees are weird. Master's degrees in English are weird. This page of the website is definitely weird.</p>
		
			<img src="weekly/media/bernie-git-gud.jpeg" alt="Bernie Sanders meme reading I am once again asking you to git gud" style="float:right; margin: 10px;"/>
			
			<p>If you've known me ever at all, you know I like CRPGs. Especially what many today would consider to be the old, unforgiving kind, like Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, or The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The rulesets are complex (weapon proficiency tables and spellcasting especially) and lame-sounding enemies like spiders <em>will</em> nuke you in two hits. Character creation was so challenging that just getting through building a character might take hours of poring through build guides online, all to build a character that died instantly in the first combat encounter. And quest directions in Morrowind would amount to "yeah, that cave is to the northeast, past the big boulder, beside some giant mushrooms." (Basically all of Morrowind is boulders and mushrooms, so, yeah... not helpful.) There's no tutorial level, and you're just thrown in the deep end. Figure it out. You'll get there eventually. Oh, and save a lot. &#128520;</p>

			<p>Grad school can be the same way. Save a lot, and if you don't understand THAC0 up front, well, you'll figure it out eventually. You're here because you've done the student thing already, and probably figured out how to do it well. But like video games, with graduate school, there's a level up, and it can hurt if you're not ready for it.</p>
			
			<p>In this particular English department at this particular school, syllabi for graduate courses are commonly populated by some version of a list of "Expectations" for gradaute students. These lists are more or less similar, with iterations that can tell you a lot about individual faculty members' experiences if you read them carefully enough. The expecations lists come out of a handful of different desires on the part of faculty. They want you to know "what it means to be a graduate student." Most generously, these lists help to make transparent (or at least acccessible) the presumed traditional habitus and dispositions of graduate students in the humanities. TBH these are deeply rooted in an array of norms for what it means to be an academic: your full-time job is school or at least school-adjacent, you're a white dude, you have a certain type of liberal arts education and have read the a certain list of books in certain types of ways, you have a reasonable amount of financial stability, you aren't expected to be a primary caregiver for children or elders, you're more or less abled, neurotypical, and have access to healthcare. Yeah, that's a pretty screwy list.</p>
			
			<p>Even for your faculty who don't have these characteristics, these things underpinned their own experience of graduate school and inform their understanding of what it means to be a graduate student today. And those therefore fold in to faculty's own (our own--I'm in this group too, of course) assumptions about who you are and how you should go about the business of your education.</p>

			<p>I offer all this woolgathering as a sort of preface to my own versions of these lists. I think it's important to understand what you're getting into, which significantly includes what we/I as faculty think you're getting into. Mostly, I want to dialogue with you and interrogate the expectations lists on this page: on what they are, and what they mean.</p>

			<h2>Expectations graduate professors have for graduate students</h2>
			
			<p>Bona fide graduate student behavior  is distinguished in at least five ways (but I encourage you to talk back and help me rearticulate this list: What do graduate professors/I expect from graduate students/you?):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Students read assignments on time and come to class with serious responses and a willingness to discuss them</li>
				<li>Students do not assume that an assignment is legitimate only if it is graded. The work is done for its own learning value</li>
				<li>Students expect to attend every class, and make arrangements to ensure that this happens</li>
				<li>Students approach all readings and coursework with an open mind and a spirit of curiosity. They work to understand ideas and texts prior to attacking or dismissing them</li>
				<li>Students assume that open and equitable discussion is the soul of a graduate seminar. Everyone participates. Rather than expecting the professor or other students to originate or maintain discussion, students take on the responsibility to contribute their share</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Expecations graduate students have for graduate professors</h2>
			
			<p>The following list comes from the Fall 2021 students in this course and reflects their needs and concerns, but I encourage you to talk back and help me rearticulate this list: What do graduate students/you expect from their/your professors/me?</p>
			<p>A graduate professorsâ€™ behavior is distinguished in at least five ways.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Professors encourage and hold a safe space for open discussion, ideas and collaboration from all students with the recognition that each student brings different levels of technological experience and literacy to the classroom</li>
				<li>Professors encourage students to engage and apply academic materials within and beyond the classroom; they provide thoughtful discussion topics that cultivate engaging conversations </li>
				<li>Professors provide clear goals and expectations for students with clear instructions</li>
				<li>Professors provide avenues for students to ask questions about assignments and other class-related work, both inside and outside of class meetings</li>
				<li>Professors answer emails and questions within a reasonable time and are flexible and understanding about individual circumstances within reason</li>
			</ul>
