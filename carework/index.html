<h1>Notes from Home</h1>
<p>Have you ever been working from home and your daughter is in the same room doing 7th grade band via ZOOM and she's playing mouthpiece drills on her clarinet across the kitchen table from you so your phone stops whatever you're doing on it to auto-search MUCINEX? That's kind of how this pandemic has been going for me and my family.</p>

<p>We probably all remember "BBC Dad" Professor Robert Kelly, who was famously interrupted on live television in 2017:

<h2>From JOMR CFP</h2>
<p>CFP: We want to make this really clear: this is not a typical CFP, and we are not looking for academic essays about writing in the time of COVID. Instead, we are looking for short (and we mean short) personal narratives and reflections about the intersection of carework and multimodal composing during COVID. We want to know about the barriers you faced in your writing during the pandemic, and the multimodal compositions you created as you navigated carework for yourself or others. We especially want to feature the stories of multiply-marginalized graduate students, contingent faculty, independent scholars, and pre-tenure and non-tenure-track faculty.

<p>situating self as pretenure ciswhitemale but also parent to multiple neurodivergent and elsewhise disabled children, ADHD, ASD, CKD, etc.</p>

<p>In fall 2020, trying to embrace a kind of "this is normal but weird" in my online classes (been teaching a while), I was immediately disrupted by the playful antics of my 8-yr-old son.</p>
<h3>Outtake 3</h3> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lFwriOEqLX0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Used to seeing disability as a disruption (still struggle with this, honestly), but one that my profession and positionality are generally able to facilitate--as a white male, I am less judged for taking time out for kid stuff (and may be invisibly rewarded with "hero" status--thinking about the narratives around single working moms versus single working dads). As a pre-tenured assistant professor, who regularly teaches online asynchronously, I am generally able to take the afternoon or the day whenever I need to take my daughter to see her specialists, maybe missing a meeting but with a work and teaching schedule that is generally uninerrupted--or that is not penalized when it is interrupted.</p>

<p>These videos are cute, playful, fun--structured as "outtakes" (there are only a few that I kept early on in that semester most have been deleted) and designed to be shared on my personal social media. But they also reveal the struggles of teaching and learning during the pandemic, when we all went home and went online for school.</p>
<p>Outtakes 1-5 show off a day, early on in the semester (but not early in the pandemic) where I decided to just go for it, to embrace the silly, and play with my kid. But how many videos went interrupted and deleted? Or not even shot in the first place, because there were five of us in the house all trying to learn and teach and use the wi-fi at the same time?</p>
<p>A constant reminder to me about the variety of uncontrolledness of our situations.</p>
<p>Every year on my annual review I note that I want to use video more frequently in my online classes. But doing video at home with everybody home... yeah.
