    <h3>Digital Literacy Autobiography</h3>
    <p>Write about a technology that has affected your skills, abilities, and/or experiences as a writer and/or as a reader. This is not a research paper. This assignment is an autobiography—a piece in which you tell a story about yourself as a writer and/or as a reader, specifically a story about how technology has changed your approaches to writing or to reading.</p>

    <h3>Rhetorical Analysis</h3>
    <p>Choose a piece of digital media to explore and prepare a rhetorical analysis of it based on your reading of Lingua Fracta. Your rhetorical analysis should be delivered as a written report of 6-8 MLA or APA manuscript-formatted pages.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
    <h3>Review Online Digital Rhetoric journal</h3>
    <p>You will be assigned one of the following “digital rhetoric” scholarly journals: Kairos, Enculturation, Hybrid Pedagogy, Computers & Composition Online, or one of a few others. Write up a review of the last five published issues, with an eye to three questions:</p>
    <ol>
			<li>What subjects does the journal publish on? Based on the last five issues, what sorts of research are scholars publishing and how does it fit under the general umbrella of digital rhetoric? </li>
			<li>What kinds of media do webtext or article authors use? Survey the different forms that scholarship seems to take in the issues you review. </li>
			<li>What’s the ‘coolest’ piece you see in the recent issue? What technological literacies would you need to compose such a webtext? </li>
		</ol>

    <h3>Seminar Project</h3>
    <p>This is as close as we’ll get to the classic “seminar paper.” Take a deep dive on a concept, question, or idea that’s interested you from our readings this semester. Collect scholarly literature on the subject, including at least three conversants. Your project, in whatever medium you publish in, should not only review the scholarly conversation but also engage with that conversation--both in terms of the argument you make and the medium you use to deliver your argument. </p>
    <p>Regardless of medium, all projects are required to include a correctly-formatted bibliography according to MLA or APA guidelines. Please consult the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers (7th ed) or the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (6th ed, 2nd printing) accordingly.</p>
