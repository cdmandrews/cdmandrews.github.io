<p>This course overviews digital rhetoric: an interdisciplinary field offering scholars, teachers, and makers an array of theories, methods, and practices for working with digital texts. We will survey scholarship in digital rhetoric and explore the relevance of that work for composition teaching and professions in writing and technical communication. You will practice digital research methods such as distant reading to develop a research project on a topic of your choosing. You will also add to your technical and rhetorical skills to evaluate and compose accessible and usable digital texts, including building your own personal or professional profile/portfolio site.</p>
