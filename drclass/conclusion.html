    <h2>Conclusions here</h2>
    <p>roll back to the scholarship/theory page</p>
    <h3>Notes on reflections—what did we/they find? What did we/they make them mean?</h3>

<p>The odd space of the MA student (professional, academic, not sure?) and the struggle to make connections—new sense of field, the very disciplinary way that journals makes sense. Students needed more context—to be closer to those terms. Project would likely be more useful in a Ph.D program (where students have more time to read and think about their space in a professional academic discipline more)</p>

<p>Utility, professionalization, and medium. The sense that we were “just playing around” with word clouds—that is, the exploratory way they were presented, but also the playful visual rhetoric of word clouds themselves—really pushed against taking them seriously.  As Carolina put it (and other reflections really display), students across the timeline of the program—both new and about-to-graduate-- had “what the heck is going on here” moments that were rooted in their expectations about the medium and what counts as graduate school work (i.e. writing seminar papers and doing narrowly defined bibliographic research). I.e. leaving our normal interfaced activities (writng) to something very new media. Some folks really took to the clouds; others fought them.</p>

<p>Limitations of word clouds: without context (heck, even with some context), understanding what words reveal or what words can reveal is difficult. Word frequency data does not—as Philly reminds us—speak for itself.</p>

<p>Even alongside readings of core texts in digital rhetoric, some students really struggled to understand how word clouds were 1) an enactment of d. r. praxis and 2) a tool that could reveal something about digital rhetoric.</p>

<p>Difficulty of determining what scale word clouds are useful at and what objects word clouds are useful for reading.  Very useful in thinking about “being methodological” (how why we look and how we look are related) and how we get meaning from these processes.</p>

<p>Not sure tying it to trying to understand and define digital rhetoric (or the concerns of digital rhetoric) was useful or even possible. (Despite explicitly trying to get them to connect back to Eyman’s extended definition of digital rhetoric’s field of vision, few students really saw this.) Indeed this might be the mightiest failure (or success?) of the project. Rolled out as intending to help students understand what digital rhetoric (publications) are concerned with, students </p>

    <h2>old draughty gibberings here</h2>
    <p>Distant reading as au courant reading methodology for digital rhetoric studies (emphasis on clouds/terms over time)</p>
    <p>Distant reading as grad student learning methodology (emphasis on discovery, invention: reading proairetically and paratactically; supplementing survey with distance; allowing the copiousness of distant reading’s stance on a copia to gain entry to…. (also the problem of disciplinarity—how do students get a sense of (read) the sub-disciplines of English? (do we need to ‘distant read’ some other journals in this case? Do we read the “locations” of the digital/multimodal scholarship we’ve analyzed (mapping home institutions of authors, for example?) (what about “pathways woven across other fields”?). NOT worried about coherence or “discipliniography” (Mueller 2018, p13), ludic impulsivity?</p>
    <p>So what? So what do the word clouds show us? Is it about the word clouds, or is it about “digital rhetoric” or is it about ____? Or… what do we have to do with/after the word clouds to make them meaningful (beyond their exemplar status as digital rhetoric interface/rhetorical ecologies? Or is this about learning to be ___? </p>
    <p>From my own instructorial perspective, the learning goals for the project are (mwahaha)</p>
