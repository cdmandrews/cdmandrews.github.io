    <p>roll back to the scholarship/theory page</p>

  <p>The "Distant Reading of a Scholarly Journal" assignment invited graduate students to create a series of word cloud visualizations of multiple issues of an academic journal, reflect on what their distant readings revealed, and publish their findings multimodally, on a web page. The assignment was designed to both illustrate principles and practices of digital rheotric through praxis as well as offer practice in multimodal digital composing. The assignment asked students to create word clouds of recent issues of scholarly journals related to digital rhetoric. After creating their individual distant readings, students reflected on, analyzed, and shared their clouds with the class (published as HTML pages as part of a larger profile/portfolio site project), inviting conversation both about what sorts of readings are possible through this medium as well as themes or patterns that provided a way into particular scholarly journals or a sense of topics and recent trends in digital rhetoric.</p>
  <p>Distant reading, introduced in 2000 by Franco Moretti, has been brought into writing studies and other fields to help address a variety of research questions. Among these problems is scholars’ (historically recurring) sense of the increasing accessibility and resulting overabundance of texts available. The problem of too many texts means that navigating and making sense of text, data, and various knowledges and disciplinary discourses, and entering into those conversations, can be difficult for newcomers to a field—that is, for someone trying to explore and construct scholarly identities in various knowledge practices and imagine new avenues of research and participation. One method of distant reading is through the construction of visual models such as word clouds, which can allow novices to try to make some sense of the foreign terrains built in various discourse communities. Word clouds as a form of distant reading and network visualization have been offered up as potential entry points for newcomers to scholarly disciplines (Brooke, 2009; Mueller, 2017). In this assignment I attempted to have students engage word clouds in that way: as a distant practice of novitiate word-watching in the field of digital rhetoric.</p>
  
  <p>As the instructor, I had three goals for the assignment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use distant reading as a method of inquiry to introduce a discipline (i.e. a way in to digital rhetoric—dealing with “the new”)</li>
    <li>Understand distant reading as an example of digital rhetorical theory (i.e. how we make meaning with digital texts, the nature of digital rhetoric, etc.)</li>
    <li>Use distant reading to practice Low-fi digital web composing (making a thing, writing with readymades, working with HTML/CSS and other technologies to understand web authoring)
</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Students also had these broad goals for the course in mind as they interpreted the assignment, as presented on the syllabus:</p>
  <blockquote>We will survey scholarship in digital rhetoric and explore the relevance of that work for composition teaching and professions in writing and technical communication. You will practice digital research methods such as distant reading to develop a research project on a topic of your choosing. You will also add to your technical and rhetorical skills to evaluate and compose accessible and usable digital texts, including building your own personal or professional profile/portfolio site.</blockquote>

<p>For me, the problem of how (or even whether) to introduce "a field" is a tough one to solve, and has been especially so when I’ve tried to teach versions of a graduate course in “digital rhetoric.” Should I focus on a general introduction and survey, emphasizing core, “canonical” theories (and texts) that students will be able to build upon in later study? Do I try to draw upon the deeply diverse and inclusive contemporary state of the field? How do I help my students balance breadth and depth? Is that binary even meaningful? What about just coming in and getting the work done? These questions are, as always, complicated by the institutional contexts of my course and graduate program and the disciplinary contexts (or, often, lack thereof) of the students in that course. In a relatively small 36-hour generalist Master of Arts in English with specializations (only nominal, about 6 hours) in literary or writing studies, at a region-serving HSI, I can expect to be introducing fundamental concepts of digital rhetorical theory—not to mention rhetorical theory itself—to most students for the first time.</p>
<p>Frankly, it’s a lot to pin on some word clouds…</p>






    <h3>Notes on reflections—what did we/they find? What did we/they make them mean?</h3>


<hr>
<h3> drafty bits to trim below </h3>
<p>The odd space of the MA student (professional, academic, not sure?) and the struggle to make connections—new sense of field, the very disciplinary way that journals makes sense. Students needed more context—to be closer to those terms. Project would likely be more useful in a Ph.D program (where students have more time to read and think about their space in a professional academic discipline more)</p>

<p>Utility, professionalization, and medium. The sense that we were “just playing around” with word clouds—that is, the exploratory way they were presented, but also the playful visual rhetoric of word clouds themselves—really pushed against taking them seriously.  As Carolina put it (and other reflections really display), students across the timeline of the program—both new and about-to-graduate-- had “what the heck is going on here” moments that were rooted in their expectations about the medium and what counts as graduate school work (i.e. writing seminar papers and doing narrowly defined bibliographic research). I.e. leaving our normal interfaced activities (writng) to something very new media. Some folks really took to the clouds; others fought them.</p>

<p>Limitations of word clouds: without context (heck, even with some context), understanding what words reveal or what words can reveal is difficult. Word frequency data does not—as Philly reminds us—speak for itself.</p>

<p>Even alongside readings of core texts in digital rhetoric, some students really struggled to understand how word clouds were 1) an enactment of d. r. praxis and 2) a tool that could reveal something about digital rhetoric.</p>

<p>Difficulty of determining what scale word clouds are useful at and what objects word clouds are useful for reading.  Very useful in thinking about “being methodological” (how why we look and how we look are related) and how we get meaning from these processes.</p>

<p>Not sure tying it to trying to understand and define digital rhetoric (or the concerns of digital rhetoric) was useful or even possible. (Despite explicitly trying to get them to connect back to Eyman’s extended definition of digital rhetoric’s field of vision, few students really saw this.) Indeed this might be the mightiest failure (or success?) of the project. Rolled out as intending to help students understand what digital rhetoric (publications) are concerned with, students </p>

    <h2>old draughty gibberings here</h2>
    <p>Distant reading as au courant reading methodology for digital rhetoric studies (emphasis on clouds/terms over time)</p>
    <p>Distant reading as grad student learning methodology (emphasis on discovery, invention: reading proairetically and paratactically; supplementing survey with distance; allowing the copiousness of distant reading’s stance on a copia to gain entry to…. (also the problem of disciplinarity—how do students get a sense of (read) the sub-disciplines of English? (do we need to ‘distant read’ some other journals in this case? Do we read the “locations” of the digital/multimodal scholarship we’ve analyzed (mapping home institutions of authors, for example?) (what about “pathways woven across other fields”?). NOT worried about coherence or “discipliniography” (Mueller 2018, p13), ludic impulsivity?</p>
    <p>So what? So what do the word clouds show us? Is it about the word clouds, or is it about “digital rhetoric” or is it about ____? Or… what do we have to do with/after the word clouds to make them meaningful (beyond their exemplar status as digital rhetoric interface/rhetorical ecologies? Or is this about learning to be ___? </p>
    <p>From my own instructorial perspective, the learning goals for the project are (mwahaha)</p>
