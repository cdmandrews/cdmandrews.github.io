<h3>Generating Word Clouds in Reflective Voice</h3>
<p>In reflection, I would like to think through the creation of word clouds I have gained a greater grasp of the field and definition of digital rhetoric. I would like to think that creating word clouds and careful discussions with fellow classmates have prepared me to speak more confidently on the subject, to think through the puzzle of what word clouds are and why they are meaningful, and to successfully use distant reading to prepare a poignant analysis that furthers scholarship in digital rhetoric.</p>
<p>I would like to think all of those things are true because I am a graduate student hoping to stake a greater claim in the field of digital rhetoric; it can be hard to admit that I don’t know what, if anything, I’ve learned. The hopeful future teacher in me protests that I learned something, even or especially when I don’t feel that way, but the “realistic” side of me, the one trying to figure out how to get from point A to point Z, reluctantly doubts it.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through some of that reluctant doubt in reflective voice:</p>
<p>What was I supposed to learn? The learning outcomes (LO) as written in the original syllabus for the entire course are listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students will compose with attention to multiple and layered elements of digital writing conventions and documents, creating academic, expressive, poetic, and other rhetorical texts in a variety of media</li>
  <li>Students will study how digital media enable and shape rhetorical and cultural expression and analyze such expression through rhetorical analysis</li>
  <li>Students will learn research methods for digital rhetoric, including audience- and media-appropriate documentation for the texts they compose</li>
</ul>
<p>I will refer to these three bullet points as LO1, LO2, and LO3.</p>
<p>LO1 nearly doesn’t apply, although I might consider each of our in-progress documents created around and with attention to these word clouds as part of “creating academic… rhetorical texts.” The word clouds themselves might also be an example of a convention of digital writing or a form of media. Though I technically did not “create” the words in the world cloud, I put in an extensive amount of work preparing and arranging the word clouds for final sharing. I will need to make different decisions from my original in order to create word clouds that conform to our group decision.</p>
<p>I feel like I have only made headway on half of LO2 (which we changed midway through the course), which may contribute to my own feelings of not having actually contributed anything: while I feel I have studied “how digital media enable and shape rhetorical and cultural expression,” at least in theory, I do not feel that I have yet taken any steps towards analysis. I have proferred an initial analysis of my own word clouds, but I feel that I am in fact waiting for the full class to submit word clouds before we really dig into the analysis, which makes reflection feel difficult. How can I reflect on my work if I haven’t really done anything yet? I have gathered data, arranged it, and prepared to prepare to look at it… but I don’t truly feel I’ve taken the time to form an analysis because I feel like I’m in a weird waiting place; wait for your classmates, wait for the professor to tell you what to do, or just wait until the final assignment is ready so you can contribute your thoughts. </p>
<p>Considering LO3, I feel like these word clouds are a version of a research method, one that we have learned, but not one that we have yet actively applied. Like with LO2, I feel like I am still stuck waiting in the first half of this process, the pulling data and research side, rather than formulating ideas or thoughts or analysis, or anything particularly useful.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am reaching a bit too broadly; this distant reading project was only one assignment in the course, not solely responsible for the final learning outcomes. If I dial down into the assignment description as listed on the syllabus, my outcomes for this assignment are narrower in scope: “Distant reading of digital rhetoric-related scholarly journal: You will be assigned a scholarly journal related to digital rhetoric. Become a "word watcher" (Mueller, p. 73) and conduct a distant reading of the last five published issues. Create a series of word clouds to share and discuss with your classmates, and publish them as a webtext on your profile/portfolio site.” While my learning objectives seem more theoretically-based, this course assignment seems much more grounded in practice. While we had much theory-based reading, our assignments seemed to expect us to start at some proverbial “bottom” of practice; we went fully lo-fi, trying to build sites from scratch. This approach really required time learning HTML and CSS, as opposed to making some of the theory-based rhetorical choices we were reading about.</p>

<p>If a “word watcher,” as Mueller (2017) describes, must “seek to make explicit the tacit and unexplored subtleties, admitting these intricacies to the discussion” that can be seen through a method of distant or thin reading, then I worry I have failed in my role. In fact, Mueller seems to predict this potential downfall of word clouds: “Simply, word clouds are methodologically basic, but they function as powerful setups for the sort of word watching that helps us understand turns and threshold concepts so that we can more wittingly participate in the cultivation of them.” As I attempt to explain in greater detail below, the development of word clouds without a specific analytic intent seems incapable of producing the type of knowledge I hoped to gain.</p>

<p>I hoped to use word clouds to quickly (distantly, thinly) learn about the field of digital rhetoric so that I might find a place for myself as a scholar and hopeful future educator. To explore why I perceive this goal as a failure, I return to the idea of digital rhetoric as both a field and a term that defies a solid definition. The simplest version of that term, one that has been expanded on and returned to by Eyman (2015), might be “the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances” (p. 44). With the understanding that this simple definition does not quite do the term justice, we can see the emphasis both on “theory” and “production” that is echoed in the writing of other technorhetoricians; digital rhetoric essentially requires both scholarship and production. In this case, I think my biggest struggle with this course has been what feels like a lack of actual production. Word clouds, on their own, do not seem to provide enough information for an analysis; they are only a starting point, a sense of data, that requires more (of what?) in order to contribute meaningfully to a discussion. Alone, word clouds don’t help us understand digital rhetoric, although they might make a useful tool to supplement an argument.</p>

<p>When I think about rhetorical choices, I can only consider the specific choices I made when pulling and shaping my data into word clouds. I approached the assignment with a specific intention: I wanted to generate word clouds for the 5 issues of Computers and Composition I was assigned so I could better see the existing conversations and potential gaps for my hopeful future contribution. To that effect, I left in as much information as I could with the thought process that the more I had, the more I could analyze; I was particularly keen to leave in names and references so I could find the “key players” for my own future reading and studying. I hoped these word clouds would do some of the heavy lifting that comes with reading; as a grad student, full-time employee, and a mom I don’t have as much time to read and write as I would like. I hoped creating word clouds could somehow provide a distant view of the publications and enable me to quickly and confidently jump into conversations with appropriate scholarly research and knowledge without having to actually read all of the things. Coming from literary analysis, I was comfortable with close reading at the sentence and paragraph level; while I gained useful analytical skills, I really struggled to come up with the “so what” conclusiveness for my analyses. I felt like I was too deep into the forest, exploring the trees; I hoped distant reading via word clouds would help me see the shape of the forest to make more accurate analyses that meant something. Perhaps because I don’t feel that I have done this in practice yet, I don’t know that word clouds have given me this ability.</p>
