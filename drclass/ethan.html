    <h2>An Active Ecological Approach to Digital Writing Education</h2>

  <p>In engaging with an active but thin and distant approach to research, I found myself recognizing research as intimately involved in writing, in active construction rather than passive consumption, and not constrained solely to fixed disciplinary structures, but instead to emergent networks in which I joined, mediated, negotiated, and enacted. As Mueller (2017) writes,</p>

  <blockquote>Tag clouds, as I will demonstrate much more thoroughly in Chapter Three, constitute one variety of distant reading, one variety of thin description, and, as such, they prompt an acutely language-based instance of network sense—one impression of disciplinarity as constituted by a discoverable and traceable semantic network. These methods—and the tag cloud created with them in mind—create a temporary clearing, holding the text at bay so that we might see it instead as a semantic network with concentrations of terms coalescing throughout it. (p. 5)</blockquote>

  <p>Surely I’m not saying we all need to be making word clouds in our writing classrooms, but I do think that in constructing something tangible, visible, and open to further questioning, we can reclaim research’s situatedness and situating role, and our own active role as developing writers and scholars. And isn’t that the role of a graduate education, particularly at the liminal space of the Master’s level, so wedged between the undergraduate and the PhD? Mueller (2017) further says that</p>

  <blockquote>Simply, word clouds are methodologically basic, but they function as powerful setups for the sort of word watching that helps us understand turns and threshold concepts so that we can more wittingly participate in the cultivation of them. Word clouds make possible what I describe as a nephological attitude toward the relationship between disciplinary language and epistemology—between the words we use and what we claim to know. (p. 79)</blockquote>

  <p>Conversely, in engaging with lo-fi HTML/CSS webtext authoring, I quickly found out that I needed to see what other writers/scholars were doing with their own webtexts. In advocating the use of lo-fi writing practices in “The LO-FI Manifesto,” Stolley argues exactly this, that “the richest learning experiences reveal how failure and crude initial work transform to something better only through ongoing research and revision” (par. 5). I needed, for my writing to be most effective in achieving its purposes, to explore and research, and all the while integrate, remix, and play. The supposed linearity of process is seriously troubled and felt upon having these writing experiences in our graduate classroom. As Brooke (2009) points out, this is because “new media invites us to rethink (or reinvent) the canons of classical rhetoric, understanding them as practices that might, in turn, be used to understand the proliferation of interfaces that surround us” (p. xiii).</p>

  <p>As a class, we made a decision to work collaboratively and revise/add to our findings in these activities, rather than engage in the planned course activities--rhetorical analysis and annotated bibliography. I believe that our redirection in our writing efforts was due to the disconnect we would have had to make in leaving our interfaced activities subject to ongoing revision in the clearest sense (GitHub’s memory/persistence of revisions, for example), to closed forms of writing that, though they may be useful in some sense, would be restricted to the page, and counterintuitive to our ecological understandings of digital writing. Along these lines, Brooke (2009) argues that “new media challenges us to reconceive our basic unit of analysis; the mutability of new media means that we should be shifting our focus from textual objects to medial interfaces … [and] the classical canons of rhetoric can be rethought in ecological terms, as an ecology of practice” (p. 6).Though the typical annotated bibliography can indeed be helpful, it can also discourage an active approach to writing and research, in that the need to close-in on meanings and attribute those meanings to authors can quickly become a crowding of the blank page with constraining voices, rather than a weaving of voices contributing to a heuristic interaction with interface-as-activity. For Brooke (2009), “a rhetoric of new media, rather than examining the choices that have already been made by writers, should prepare us as writers to make our own choices. Such a rhetoric cannot be achieved through the reactive lens of critical/theoretical reading” (p. 15). Rather, I think in preparing us as writers to make choices, in developing theories of writing that are robust enough to account for new experiences and thus conducive to transfer, we are enacting at the same time a critical and reactive view at the same time that we are deciding to act on certain choices.</p>

  <p>And finally, some questions I’m left with regarding my takeaways from the activities in this digital rhetoric class: I’m a prospective first-year writing teacher, and I’m interested in curricular design. How can I, too, take into account the ecological model that Brooke (2009) writes about, the thin and distant approach advocated by Mueller (2017), the LO-FI writing that Stolley argues for, and the attention to rhetorical velocity that Ridolfo and DeVoss (2009) theorize? In other words, how can these theories inform what activities students do in FYW, or in the given constraints on the curriculum guidelines of the institution, how can they inform design for effective student learning experiences that allow students to develop theories of writing that account for these theories in future practice, and are most conducive for transfer? I don’t have answers to these questions, but they are central in my continued research.</p>
