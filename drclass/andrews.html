    <h2>But why clouds?</h2>
  <p>As the instructor, I had three goals for the assignment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use distant reading as a method of inquiry to introduce a discipline (i.e. a way in to digital rhetoric—dealing with “the new”)</li>
    <li>Understand distant reading as an example of digital rhetorical theory (i.e. how we make meaning with digital texts, Brooke’s updated canons, etc)</li>
    <li>Use distant reading to practice Low-fi digital web composing (making a thing, writing with readymades, working with HTML/CSS and other technologies to understand web authoring)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Students also had these broad goals for the course in mind as they interpreted the assignment, as presented on the syllabus:</p>
    <blockquote>We will survey scholarship in digital rhetoric and explore the relevance of that work for composition teaching and professions in writing and technical communication. You will practice digital research methods such as distant reading to develop a research project on a topic of your choosing. You will also add to your technical and rhetorical skills to evaluate and compose accessible and usable digital texts, including building your own personal or professional profile/portfolio site.</blockquote>
  <p>For me, the problem of how (or even whether) to introduce a field is a tough one to solve, and has been especially so when I’ve tried to teach versions of a graduate course in digital rhetoric. Should I focus on a general introduction and survey, emphasizing core, canonical theories (and texts) that students will be able to build upon in later study? Do I try to draw upon the deeply diverse and inclusive contemporary state of the field? How do I help my students balance breadth and depth? Is that binary even meaningful? What about just coming in and getting the work done? These questions are, as always, complicated by the institutional contexts of my course and graduate program and the disciplinary contexts (or, often, lack thereof) of the students in that course. In a relatively small 36-hour generalist Master of Arts in English with specializations (only nominal, about 6 hours) in literary or writing studies, at a region-serving Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), I can expect to be introducing fundamental concepts of digital rhetorical theory&mdash;not to mention rhetorical theory itself&mdash;to most students for the first time. </p>
  <p>Frankly, it’s a lot to pin on some word clouds…</p>

<h3>Condensation: Where clouds come from</h3>
  <p>The desire to map or locate, or describe the boundaries of composition studies, composition and rhetoric, and writing studies is well-established in the field’s scholarship. The  general problem of “situating oneself in the field” or "introducing a discipline” was for me precedented in two specific ways. The first came from my own experiences as an MA-level graduate teaching assistant. All of the GAs were tasked with joining and lurking on the WPA-L (an assignment I know others have done, from anecdotal reporting on that listserv over the years). Our grad director encouraged us to read the list <strong>inventively</strong>: Instead of presenting  a singular representative version of composition and rhetoric, our WPA-L lurking was intended to help us broaden our own horizons and invent the discipline for ourself a bit, seeing what sorts of ideas, topics, attitudes, and behaviors (sometimes bad behaviors) typified members of that community. We would write about and discuss the threads we saw and studied both in a teaching practicum and in individual meetings with the graduate teaching director, connecting threads and discussions to pedagogical problems and theoretical texts in composition and rhetoric.</p>
  <p>The second and more direct inspiration for this assignment is Derek Mueller’s work in </cite>Network Sense: Methods for Visualizing a discipline</cite>. In his closing chapters, Mueller explicitly offered distant reading methods as appropriate for “newcomers and initiates” to the field who are trying to figure out “where to begin” (p. 168), both in the sense of professional beginnings (using distant/thin reading to figure out which graduate schools to apply to based on the results of distant reading of faculty and alumni publications) and in the sense of those opening steps down a line of inquiry, an opening step that includes indexing texts from a particular publication and tracing key terms into the scholarly record (p. 169).  Both of these precedents—along with the fairly common activity among my own and other graduate cohorts of creating Wordles and other word clouds of my own writing after these tools became available—engage in a proairetic reading of the discipline: synoptic views and interfaces with the larger texts of the discipline afforded by their own (very different) digital texts. </p>
