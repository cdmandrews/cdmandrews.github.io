    <h2>The assignment: Goals and issues</h2>
      <p>In this course project, I asked students to take a scholarly journal (largely open access and online journls), extract their content into plain text files, and create simple word clouds based on them. The project invited them to create clouds, reflect on what they "meant" (if they meant anything at all), and try to connect them to our reading earlier in the course&mdash;primarily Eyman's (2015) <cite>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice</cite>, but also VanKooten's (2016) "Methodologies and methods for research in digital rhetoric", Hodgson and Barnett's (2016) "What is Rhetorical about Digital Rhetoric? Perspectives and Definitions of Digital Rhetoric," Zappan's (2005) "Digital rhetoric: Toward an integrated theory," and Brooke's (2009) <cite>Lingua Fracta</cite>, and a variety of other theoretical and practical texts.</p>

      <p>As well as being a challenge to other modes of reading, these word clouds were also intended to be work in lo-fi (Stolley 2016) multimodal authoring with readymades&mdash;students created clouds and then built markdown and HTML pages to publish them on their individual class websites, attending to the complex interrrelationships between rhetoric, design, and code (Eyman and Ball 2014).</p>

      <p>Reflecting on the clouds and commentary created in the course of this project (presented throughout this webtext), two key weaknesses emerged. (And honestly, I must chalk a great deal of this up to my own presentation of the materials.)</p>
      <p><strong>First</strong>, the project was framed as if it would be a way into "digital rhetoric" in general rather than into the individual conceptual worlds of each publication. That is, as a result of the final question asked ("How has this reading (and publishing) activity helped you make sense of digital rhetoric?") and a few minor but important mentions of digital rhetoric in the project descirption, many class members expected&mdash;you can see this in their various reflections&mdash;that the result would, in fact, be some sort of revelation about the nature and contents of the field. Because the question emphasized reading and parenthesized production, the word clouds' inability to easily reveal answers led some cloud-makers to mark the experiment as a failure. Also, as readers familiar with those publications would point out, not all of the journals included in the list are "digital rhetoric" journals in the sense of the journal's scope being keyed in to that particular field. Some journals are truly all about digital rhetoric, while others are digital, open acess journals that treat topics relevant to digital rhetoric scholars. That is, these journals often <strong>do</strong> digital rhetoric, but they are not always <strong>about</strong> digital rhetoric, a point that the I chould have made much clearer at the outset.</p>

      <p>A <strong>second</strong> weakness was in the class not shifting to a close reading activity using some of the same materials after distant readings were complete. How would class members have responded to this activity with a different (perhaps more traditional) follow-up that asked students to dig deep into one of their issues and see what relationship the clouds bear to the journals they represent?</p>

      <p>The rest of this page presents the original text of the assignment description.</p>

      <h2>Distant reading of digital rhetoric-related scholarly journal</h2>
      <p>You will be assigned a scholarly journal more or less related to digital rhetoric. Become a "word watcher" (Mueller, p. 73) and conduct a distant reading of the last five published issues. Create a series of word clouds to share and discuss with your classmates, and publish them as a webtext on your profile/portfolio site.</p>

        <li>Computers & Composition</li>
        <li>or other publications we think should be added to the list</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Working with chapter 3 ("Turn Spotting") from Derek Mueller’s <a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/books/writing/network/"><cite>Network Sense</cite></a> and other assigned texts, conduct a distant reading of the last five published issues of your assigned/selected journal. You will create a series of word clouds to share and discuss with your classmates, and will publish them as a webtext on your profile/portfolio site.</p>

      <h3>Deliverable: series of word clouds showing your findings.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Use TagCloud, Voyant, or another appropriate tool to create word cloud visualizations of articles from five issues. We’ll collaborate to discuss methodological problems such as how many, whether to include bibliographies, web scraping, etc. You will create five separate visualizations (on TagCloud, just take a screenshot or use the HTML embed instructions; on Voyant, you can export an HTML snippet or a PNG file; if you choose to use HTML snippets, get a PNG for backup).</li>
        <li>Create a simple HTML page to publish your five visualizations on. Identify each figure with a caption and descriptive text, and use headings on the page as appropriate. We’ll add a stylesheet later.</li>
        <li>At the top of the page (before the word clouds), summarize and comment on your findings. Consider some of the following questions:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>What units of meaning does this method of reading help you apprehend?</li>
          <li>What themes, patterns, or trends do you notice in and across your word clouds?</li>
          <li>What questions, connections, patterns, or insights do they provoke?</li>
          <li>How has this reading (and publishing) activity helped you make sense of “digital rhetoric” (whatever that is)?</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
