    <h2>The word cloud project</h2>
      <p>The original project asked us to take a scholarly journal (largely open access and online journls), extract content into plain text files, and create simple word clouds based on them. The project invited us to create clouds, reflect on what they "meant" (if they meant anything at all), and try to connect them to our reading earlier in the course&mdash;in particular Douglas Eyman's survey text, <cite>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice</cite>.</p>
      <p>As well as being a challenge to other modes of reading, these word clouds were also intended to be work in multimodal authoring with readymades&mdash;we created clouds and then built HTML pages to publish them on our individual class websites). The instructor's original plan was for these distant and thin readings of a variety of sources to turn into annotated bibliographies and special topics days over the last few weeks of the course, where we could go deeper into the spaces these clouds passed so thinly over. Ultimately these plans were changed&mdash;in part because the instructor was so taken with the class' discussions of their word clouds as both enactments and representations of digital rhetoric. We also changed focus away from these original plans because students were working on and workshopping profile sites and were presented with the idea of turning their word cloud work into this webtext.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the clouds and commentary created in the course of this project (presented throughout this webtext), two key weaknesses emerge. First, the project was framed as if it would be a way into "digital rhetoric" in general rather than into the individual conceptual worlds of each publication. That is, as a result of the final question asked ("How has this reading (and publishing) activity helped you make sense of digital rhetoric?") many class members expected&mdash;you can see this in their various reflections&mdash;that the result would, in fact, be some sort of revelation about the nature and contents of the field. Because the question emphasized reading and parenthesized production, the word clouds' inability to easily reveal answers led some cloud-makers to mark the experiment as failed.</p>
      <p>A second weakness was in not shifting to a closereading activity using some of the same materials after distant readings were complete. How would class members have responded to this activity with a different (perhaps more traditional) follow-up that asked students to dig deep into one of their issues and see what relationship the clouds bear to the journals they represent?</p>
      <p>The rest of this page presents the original text of the assignment description.</p>

      <h2>Distant reading of digital rhetoric-related scholarly journal</h2>
      <p>You will be assigned a scholarly journal related to digital rhetoric. Become a "word watcher" (Mueller, p. 73) and conduct a distant reading of the last five published issues. Create a series of word clouds to share and discuss with your classmates, and publish them as a webtext on your profile/portfolio site.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Working with chapter 3 ("Turn Spotting") from Derek Mueller’s <a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/books/writing/network/"><cite>Network Sense</cite></a> and other assigned texts, conduct a distant reading of the last five published issues of your assigned/selected journal. You will create a series of word clouds to share and discuss with your classmates, and will publish them as a webtext on your profile/portfolio site.</p>
      <h3>Deliverable: series of word clouds showing your findings.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Use TagCloud, Voyant, or another appropriate tool to create word cloud visualizations of articles from five issues (we’ll collaborate to discuss methodological problems such as how many, whether to include bibliographies, web scraping, etc.,.). You will create five separate visualizations (on TagCloud, just take a screenshot or use the HTML embed instructions; on Voyant, you can export an HTML snippet or a PNG file--if you choose to use HTML snippets, get a PNG for backup).
          <li>Create a simple HTML page to publish your five visualizations on. Identify each figure with a caption and descriptive text, and use headings on the page as appropriate. (We’ll add a stylesheet later.)
          <li>At the top of the page (before the word clouds), summarize and comment on your findings. Consider some of the following questions:
        <ul>
          <li>What units of meaning does this method of reading help you apprehend?
          <li>What themes, patterns, or trends do you notice in and across your word clouds?
          <li>What questions, connections, patterns, or insights do they provoke?
          <li>How has this reading (and publishing) activity helped you make sense of “digital rhetoric” (whatever that is)?</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ol>
      <p>We will use the results of your distant readings to inform “special topic” days towards the end of the semester, reviewing current work (even “turns”?) in digital rhetoric, composition, and technical communication on topics the class agrees upon. You will also use these as entry points for your annotated bibliographies.</p>
