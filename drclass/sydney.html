    <h2>Sydney: Word watcher?</h2>
    <p>Fresh out of my undergraduate education and propelled into an English graduate program, I, along with my ENGL 5362: Digital Rhetoric peers, were assigned a project to create word clouds that would simulate/practice a research method useful for potentially surveying the digital rhetoric field.</p>
    <p>As my first course studying rhetoric, the learning curve was a challenge. At the beginning, I didn’t know how to define digital rhetoric or what constituted its parameters. For what it’s worth, I also didn’t know anything about rhetoric beyond a foggy connection to meaning, persuasion, and identity. With a nod to the canons, I’ve realized that digital rhetoric is a broad field that isn’t easy to define, and that’s okay. Eyman (2016) simplifies digital rhetoric as a field with a focus on digital as a means or mode. Hodgson and Barnett (2016) embrace it’s broadness as “exigency for conducting further research, teaching, and collaboration.” </p>
    <p>Looking at the five word clouds generated from different sequential issues of Enculturation, along with the word clouds created by my peers, each word cloud is different. The broad range of topics that emerged in our word clouds can tell us that digital rhetoric isn’t limited to a niche area but, instead, encompasses a seemingly limitless space of exploration. As a novice, this exercise to “view and/or reflect trends and patterns beyond ‘the sequentiality of print texts’” (Brooke 2009) helps introduce a broad overview of a field. Because it is a form of distant reading, word clouds are not meant to give the specifics of a text, however, they are useful in that they provide patterns or keywords to notice. So, the distant reading project was valuable because: 1) it created an opportunity to survey scholarship in an unfamiliar field and practice a digital research method and 2) it allowed me to think about the rhetorical theory we were learning and my expectations for what I would find when designing my original project’s methodology. </p>
    <p>As word clouds present “a cluster of keywords and phrases that appear most frequently in a select text or set of texts” (Mueller), it was important to me to carefully select which texts would be included in the data set. Bibliographies. Articles. Book reviews. Each textual format serves a purpose in the journal. With the goal to create word clouds that could be used to survey a scholarly field, I elected to create separate data sets of bibliographies and articles. Bibliographies could potentially tell me who the people speaking are and articles could tell me the current interests. After the first project, I found that the bibliographies didn’t provide any useful information. This was mostly due to a lack of stop words and the repetition of the same publishers or terms commonly found in a citation. Articles had the most interesting finds because the keywords presented could illuminate trends that would reveal a facet of digital rhetoric.</p>
    <p>During a discussion with my peers, we talked about how what we’re doing with the word clouds a form of genre building. Genre doesn’t exist like poof out of the air, but is created by elements that are approved by a collective. Using the word clouds to discover or enlighten ourselves on how digital rhetoric is perceived as a discipline, follows that idea. The patterns revealed in the word clouds are the elements that make up digital rhetoric as a discipline. What could have been interesting would have been comparing word clouds generated from journals over a larger time span to see what trends have emerged or disappeared. However, because we did not dive deeper beyond the creation of word clouds, discussing their purpose, and briefly discussing each other’s word clouds, I don’t feel as if I’m a word watcher (Mueller) in the sense that I’ve noticed trends and analyzed the data and what it could mean. To be a word watcher would be to take the next step after putting together word clouds.</p>
