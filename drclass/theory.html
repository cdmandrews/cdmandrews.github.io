    <h2>What word clouds do (in theory)</h2>

    <p>A primary goal for this distant reading project was to <strong>engage word clouds as a practice of novice-level word-watching</strong>. In a more-or-less introduction to digital rhetoric course situated in a more-or-less traditionally generalist Master of Arts program (combining coursework in composition, applied linguistics, and literature), the instructor had high hopes for word clouds as a way for students to begin to think about the field of digital rhetoric and its threshold concepts.</p>

    <h3>Proairetic possibilities</h3>

    <p>Since tag clouds became popular information visualization toys on the internet in the late-2000s (Sorapure 2010), their capacities for basic textual analysis have been used for a handful of purposes in literacy education, put to work to help students with their reading comprehension, reflection, and revision. With their disruption of syntactic elements and drastic reduction of a selected text, tag clouds, word clouds, or text clouds create what Derek Mueller called a "<strong>temporary clearing</strong>" (2017, p. 5), a text that contronts us immediately with abstraction rather than clarity or readability.</p>

    <p>The visualizations that result from distant reading methods (tag clouds, maps, citation graphs, and other interactive graphical models) have been cited for their introductory capacity, their offering up of epistemologically generative visions of networks. Colin Brooke (2009) called this a <strong>proairetic</strong> perspective. Proairesis (Brooke's new mediation for invention) is reading and writing to invent possibilities, as opposed to the finite reading of hermenutic invention. Similar to del.icio.us and other (now defunct) social tagging services, Brooke described his small-scale tag cloud database of CCC article keywords as a provocative visual interface for those texts&mdash;a snapshot that offers a perspective on “the investment attached to particular terms” (2009, p. 110). Though not a stand-in for close or other kinds of reading of the scholarship, Brooke posited that the “synoptic view” a word cloud’s abbreviated and visually-oriented interface provides could be useful to newcomers, though he didn’t push that insight much beyond the suggestion. Reading proairetically and paratactically, then, we might supplement our necessarily limited survey of course readings and the need to balance coverage and in-depth treatment with the longer distance from texts that word clouds afford.</p>

    <p>Text clouds have also been framed as heuristic devices. In the initial chapter of <cite>Solving Problems in Technical Communication</cite>, texts clouds are presented explicitly as a way of "mapping" and "describing the boudnaries, artifacts, and identities that constitute the field" of technical communication (Selfe &amp; Selfe, 2013, p. 10). Rather than purely computational models, to be put to this kind of work text clouds depend on careful methodological design; the difference between a text cloud and a "rhetorically useful" cloud is considerable and&mdash;as students in the class would learn&mdash;relies on understanding of what context the clouds will be used in, how clouds are generated, how to prepare and clean datasets, and how settings like stop words and word order might radically change a cloud.</p>

    <p>Distant reading methods have risen in popularity as an approach for reading disciplinarity in writing studies (Mueller 2012a and 2012b, Miller 2014, Palmeri &amp; McCorkle 2017, Gries 2017) and seen in other applications, such as in visual rhetoric (Gries 2017). Distant-thin methods of reading and research can, from this point of view, make disicplinarity “future-oriented, participatory, and heuristic” (Mueller, 2017, p. 4). What these scholars share in common is a desire to locate and generate threshold concepts and doxa in richly networked disciplines, to amplify patterns that are not sensible to traditional forms of reading and research, to open up the work and processes of discipline-shaping to newer members of their field, and to create compelling visuals that will help describe and activate these concepts in their networks by showing a variety of relationships.</p>

    <p>Similar to Brooke’s (2009) attention to proairetic invention and Mueller’s (2017) argument for embracing a <strong>nephological attitude</strong>, Linda Adler-Kassner and Elizabeth Wardle’s (2015) application of <strong>threshold concepts</strong> for writing studies allow us to consider the active participation in and use of concepts in metacognitive and heuristic ways, as writing-as-tools for <strong>naming possibilities of knowing</strong>. Rather than a canonical and dogmatic set of “defining key terms of the discipline,” threshold concepts are “much more contingent [... on] articulation of shared beliefs providing multiple ways of helping us name what we know” (p. xix). Threshold concepts have been applied in first year composition in a variety of ways&mdash;in our own program, students show they know threshold concepts by using them to <em>invent</em> knowledge in the textual artifacts they create and by drawing on their experiences and <em>imagining</em> new possibilities as they join various discourse communities. In our graduate program, students are introduced to threshold concepts as ways into research, practice, and teaching: concepts that they continually reflect on and relate to their ongoing writing experiences. These concepts are patterns students both adopt and adapt as they move through scholarly and practical conversations in their course of study.</p>

    <h3>Getting nephological</h3>
    <p>In “Views from a Distance: A Nephological Model of the CCCC’s Chair’s Addresses, 1977-2011,” Derek Mueller (2012) described the potential pattern-finding value of a nephological attitude in general and for word clouds in particular: </p>

      <blockquote>As the scholarly record grows there is an escalating value in realizing connections. This is exceedingly important for newcomers to the field who must make inroads however they can, by conversation and conventional reading and writing, of course, but also by pattern-finding, by nomadically exploring conceptual interplay across abstracts and abstractive variations, and by finding and tracing linkages among materials and ideas, new and old. (p. 1)</blockquote>

    <p>Distant readings thus potentially alleviate the trouble invoked by both kinds of “new”: 1) the tension scholars back to antiquity have felt about keeping up with ever-growing bodies of recent developments and work in a field as well as 2) the strain graduate students have felt as they enter their specializations and figure out new scenes, new disciplines, and new subdisciplines.</p>

    <p>This second trouble&mdash;the newcomer’s widening gaze&mdash;is the core focus of this webtext, which describes the experiences of a group of Master's-level graduate students as they used word clouds to figure out <em>digital rhetoric</em>&mdash;noting that for many of these students, in particular students in their first semester of graduate study, even the notion of divisions of subfields of English beyond literature and writing courses, is new terrain. Mueller’s (2012) invitation to occasionally turn our gazes “toward clouds” and seek patterns in the nomadic, conceptual, and distant readings of word clouds and other visualizations offer a chance to understand fields not as static places to join (or not), but as knowledge practices, dispositions, and areas of attention.</p>

    <p>In <cite>Network Sense</cite> (2017) Mueller posited that distant readings offer “incomplete but nevertheless vital glimpses” into disciplines (or other domains the method’s gaze is levelled at). By generating their own field threshold concepts through distant and thin methods, graduate students, as Mueller and others have pointed out, might embrace the introductory capacities of the process and also begin to think about research issues such as sampling and methodology. One way these network sensed accounts work is by corroboration--placing distant readings against other accounts of a discipline in situations where information overload is inherent (in our own case, against each others’ accounts as well as our course readings'). The presentations or results of distant readings thus offer an opportunity (however tentative and partial) to understand <em>digital rhetoric</em> In that sense, word clouds are potential interfaces for opening up a field described as broad and undefinable (Hodgson &amp; Barnett, 2016). In his own work, Mueller has created much more technically sophisticated, data-rich, and methodologically compelling distant readings than the static frequency-generated word clouds presented in this webtext can offer; however, even these "methodologically basic" abstractions allow students to begin to question the relationships between the things we claim to know and the words we use to know them (Mueller, 2017, p. 79).

    <p>Taking on their role as word watchers, the graduate students in this course were <a href="assignment.html">invited</a> to make define, reflect on, and make connections between words in publications related to digital rhetoric. Then, in trying to understand those words in their uses, the class came together to share and discuss their findings across different journals. The <a href="classroom.html">classroom</a> section of this webtext presents students' word clouds alongside their reflections and analyses of the process and result of using clouds as proairetic interfaces.</p>
