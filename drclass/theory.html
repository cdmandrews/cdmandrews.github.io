    <h2>Word clouds... in theory</h2>

    <p>A primary goal for this distant reading project was to engage word clouds as a practice of novice-level word-watching. In a more-or-less introduction to digital rhetoric course situated in a more-or-less traditionally generalist Master of Arts program (combining coursework in composition, applied linguistics, and literature), the instructor had high hopes for word clouds as a way for students to locate themselves in relation to the field of digital rhetoric and its threshold concepts.</p>

    <p>The visualizations that result from distant reading methodologies have been cited for their introductory capacity, their offering up of epistemologically generative visions of networks, or what Colin Brooke (2009) might call a “proairetic” perspective on the discipline that is “future-oriented, participatory, and heuristic” (Mueller, 2017, p. 4). Brooke described his small-scale tag cloud database of CCC article keywords as a provocative visual interface for those texts--a snapshot that offers a perspective on “the investment attached to particular terms” (2009, p. 110). Though not a stand-in for close (or other) kinds of reading of the scholarship, Brooke posited that the “synoptic view” the word cloud’s abbreviated and visually-oriented interface provides could be useful to newcomers, though he didn’t push that insight much beyond the suggestion. More recently, distant reading methods have risen in popularity as an approach for reading disciplinarity in writing studies (Mueller 2012a and 2012b, Miller 2014, Palmeri &amp; McCorkle 2017, Gries 2017) and seen in other applications, such as in visual rhetoric (Gries 2017).  What these readings share in common is a desire to locate and generate threshold concepts and doxa in richly networked disciplines. </p>

    <p>Similar to Brooke’s (2009) attention to proairetic invention and Mueller’s (2017) concept of a nephological attitude, Linda Adler-Kassner and Elizabeth Wardle’s (2015) application of threshold concepts for writing studies allow us to consider the active participation in and use of concepts in metacognitive and heuristic ways, as writing-as-tools for naming possibilities of knowing. Rather than a canonical and dogmatic set of “defining key terms of the discipline,” threshold concepts are “much more contingent [... on] articulation of shared beliefs providing multiple ways of helping us name what we know” (p. xix). Threshold concepts have been applied in first year composition in a variety of ways--in our own program, students show they know threshold concepts by using the threshold concepts to <em>invent</em> knowledge in the textual artifacts they create, by drawing on their experiences and <em>imagining</em> new possibilities as they join various discourse communities. In our graduate program, students are introduced to threshold concepts as ways into research, practice, and teach; concepts that they continually reflect on and relate to their ongoing writing experiences. These concepts are patterns students both adopt and adapt as they move through scholarly and practical conversations in their course of study.</p>

    <p>In “Views from a Distance: A Nephological Model of the CCCC’s Chair’s Addresses, 1977-2011,” Derek Mueller (2012) described the potential pattern-finding value of a nephological attitude in general and for word clouds in particular: </p>

    <blockquote>As the scholarly record grows there is an escalating value in realizing connections. This is exceedingly important for newcomers to the field who must make inroads however they can, by conversation and conventional reading and writing, of course, but also by pattern-finding, by nomadically exploring conceptual interplay across abstracts and abstractive variations, and by finding and tracing linkages among materials and ideas, new and old. (p. 1)</blockquote>

    <p>Distant readings thus alleviate the trouble invoked by both kinds of “new”: 1) the tension scholars back to antiquity have felt about keeping up with ever-growing bodies of recent developments and work in a field as well as 2) the strain graduate students have felt as they enter their specializations and figure out new scenes, new disciplines, and new subdisciplines. This second trouble&mdash;the newcomer’s widening gaze&mdash;is the core focus of this webtext, which describes the experiences of a group of Master’s-level students as they used word clouds to figure out “digital rhetoric”&mdash;noting that for many of these students, in particular students in their first semester of graduate study, even the notion of divisions of subfields of English beyond literary and writing courses is new terrain. Mueller’s (2012) invitation to occasionally turn our gazes “toward clouds” and seek patterns in the nomadic, conceptual, and distant readings of word clouds and other distant reading visualizations offer a chance to understand fields not as static places to join (or not), but as knowledge practices, dispositions, and areas of attention.</p>

    <p>In <cite>Network Sense</cite> (2017) Mueller posited that distant readings offer “incomplete but nevertheless vital glimpses” into disciplines (or other domains the method’s gaze is levelled at). By generating their own field threshold concepts through distant and thin methods, graduate students, as Mueller and others have pointed out, might embrace the introductory capacities of the process and also begin to think about research issues such as sampling and methodology. One way these network sensed accounts work is by corroboration--placing distant readings against other accounts of a discipline in situations where information overload is inherent. (in our own case, against each others’ accounts as well as our readings of Douglas Eyman’s <cite>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice</cite>)  The presentations or results of distant readings thus offer an opportunity (however tentative and partial to understand “digital rhetoric."" In that sense, our word clouds are interfaces that open up a field that has been described as broad and undefinable (Hodgson &amp; Barnett, 2016). The words that appear in these clouds (terms like student, user, and work) ensure that the “digital” in digital rhetoric doesn’t get reduced simply to mode and technology. Rather, they allow us to be better at meaning deferral by stepping back and splitting words from their specific syntagmatic context, asking us to view them paradigmatically. Reappropriated from sentences into clouds, words also become images that provoke “<em>questions</em> about disciplinary trends and relationships” (Mueller, 2017, p7, emphasis added).</p>

    <p>Taking on their role as word watchers, the graduate students in this course were invited to make connections and actively define words in publications related to digital rhetoric. Then, in trying to understand those words in their uses, they were encouraged to conceptualize them in a way that could then be explained to others unfamiliar with those definitions and their uses. This happened particularly after the class came together to share and discuss their findings across different journals, as each student studied different journals. Understanding the word webs as a possible gateway function helped them to form collaborative connections between an activity that in itself is individual... <strong>Andrews: Finish atransition-ish outro-ish sentence here that draws us into the word clouds section of the webtext.</strong></p>
