    <h2>Kelsy's Reflection</h2> <!-- or [Journal 1.0 Findings]/Journal 2.0 Findings-->
      <p>At the beginning of this semester, I decided to enroll in a Digital Rhetoric course because I am interested in the ways technology can be used to help understand and work with various types of writing. According to Eyman (2015), digital rhetoric is both the application and analysis of the rhetorical strategies at work within digital texts. This idea of looking at the rhetorical strategies of digital pieces of writing is interesting to me because as a Teaching Assistant within Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi’s First Year Writing Program, I have the unique opportunity to work with students in online and hybrid writing environments. Because of my past experience working with students in these online, technology-based spaces, I wanted to learn more about what Digital Rhetoric is and how I can apply the concepts of the course to my own classroom.</p>
      <p>One of my main interests in this course was the concept of accessibility. This concept is especially important to me because I am partially blind in one eye and often have difficulty reading certain webpages and font styles. People with visual disabilities especially have difficulty navigating web pages due to the visual nature of the internet. Because of this gap between what able-bodied individuals can do naturally on the internet and what individuals with disabilities need assistance-wise in order to complete similar tasks, the World Wide Web Consortium and the Web Accessibility Initiative announced that web designers must take accessibility features into consideration when developing web pages (W3C, 2005). When initially developing a web page with individuals with visual impairments in mind, designers must determine what alternative text they will use for images, how the pages will display to screen-reading software, and how the page may look when zoomed in to 200% or 300%, and so on.</p>
      <p>When introduced to the concept of words clouds and their nonlinear organization, I was initially concerned with how individuals with visual impairments might be at a disadvantage when “reading” this type of information. In my first round of creating word clouds from five issues of the Paitho journal, I created flat jpg images that could not be interacted with. I also relied on my own description of the word clouds to serve as the alternate text for the images, with the actual alt-text displaying the volume and issue number for each word cloud. In my second round of word clouds, however, I used TagCrowd.com to create the images from the same five issues as I used the previous time, with each image containing an interactive space where the reader is able to select each word individually. This ability to select each word individually allows readers with visual impairments to use screen-readers to have the word clouds read aloud to them. This ability, combined with my descriptions of each word cloud, should allow individuals with disabilities to more easily access and utilize my word cloud creations.</p>
      <p>Going back to my work within the First Year Writing Program, I plan to use these concepts of accessibility features and inclusivity when developing the web pages I create for my own courses. Before working with these concepts in this Digital Rhetoric class, I spent my time designing my class web pages to look engaging and fun, while only considering accessibility as an afterthought. Now, I plan to design my pages with accessibility features at the forefront of my creative process, with cosmetic design features being applied at the very end.</p>
