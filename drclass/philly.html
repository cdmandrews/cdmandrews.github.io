      <h2>What is the usefulness of art?</h2>
          <!-- Insert Reflection Paragraphs Here-->
      <p>I guess I find it funny, kind of strange, to ask what word clouds are useful for. What is kissing your spouse useful for? For that matter, what is the complexity of the English language useful for? There are very simple and functional ways to convey every idea and yet, in day to day life, we decorate our phrases with tinsel and twinkling lights no matter how messy the carpet gets. We don't say, "I am leaving." We say, "Alright, well I guess I'm heading out now before it starts raining any harder and people start driving like they've never seen water falling from the sky before." The speaker's true intent is not to deliver information to the host about his departure. It is to make a commentary on the unrelatability of other drivers. The fact of the matter is that, very often, what we are saying reveals less meaning than how and why we choose to say it. Often this is considered a lack of substance, as when a politician avoids answering a direct question with a smoke screen of exaggerated and emotional delivery. The questioner is quick to point out that the politician did not answer the question at all. But it would be folly to assume that delivery having more weight than the stripped-down message is always denoting a lack of substance. That is just one situation in which our irritation alerts us to the sway of delivery like a scratchy bit of tinsel that fell down the back of your sweater.</p>

      <p>If someone you cared about said, "I love you," in a flat, irritated, or incredulous way, would it not have a different message than if it were written in rose petals outside your window? Or what if they didn't say those words at all but blocked your fall with their whole body when you slipped on a step. For some couples this is saying, "I love you," in a manner that depends more on form than the literal substance of words. And what is the use of that? It prevents your fall yes, but in the most practical sense of language, it would not transmit any profound information from one party to the other. But in another sense, informed by art, delivery, and nuance, said couple communicates in their own language.</p>

      <p>The personal background that brought me to this project could read a bit like a word cloud itself. In the center, reading vertically down in a bold bright color, would be the word 'creative'. And to its right, flowing out like a strong branch would be the word 'writing'. But any viewer may have a hard time making sense of how all the branches and leaves grow from the same tree. 'Computer', 'political', and 'science' would all be rustling together. 'Disabilities', 'LGBTQ', 'community' and 'Mestizo' would weigh on the limbs like fruit. As a person with ADD and dyslexia this is how I read the world. It is hard to actually BE the embodiment of a word cloud and question its use to society.</p>

      <p>I approach my confusion over the question of usefulness by wondering if our project seeks to compare the flesh and dress of word clouds, which is their aesthetic representation, against their bones, which is the word-frequency data. It can hardly be argued that word-frequency data is not useful. It is used in forensic fields to track and predict the actions of unstable citizens. It is used by SEO (Search Engine Optimization) corporations to get a bead on what trending keywords will drive sales in the next quarter. It is used by sociologists and communication scholars to understand the depth of inequity for female characters and characters of color in both fiction scripts and news reports. Sociolinguists and dictionary companies use it to document shifts in word use. It is used in politics to craft campaign speeches and slogans. Yes, the bones, the sinews, and the tendons are all useful. The actual word-frequency data transmits quantifiable information in the language of research. But what about the cartilage that shapes a unique face? What about the skin and costume? What about the data visualizations that word clouds offer? Is it folly to say that only the frequency of a word in a given text matters and the way it is rendered among other words has no substance in and of it itself? I can see where a student can feel like they are merely dressing up the data.</p>

      <p>My colleagues have accurately pointed out that the word clouds don't make much sense without the context of the articles read in a linear way. But I never felt like the word clouds were intended to stand alone. As a student, I would use the word cloud almost as a table of contents before reading the article. This would help with my struggle to focus on linear readings. As a presenter, I would have, of course, read the full article and would be using the word cloud in a PowerPoint to illustrate and therefor narrate key concepts. If I were presenting on an article about the representation of people of color in early 80s sitcoms, I would know what 'person' and 'color' are in reference to without them needing to be glued together as a phrase. I could enter them as stop words so that they wouldn't show in the cloud at all. There wouldn't be a point to the presentation  if I were just summarizing the article. It would be like telling my audience they could go read it on their own and they wouldn't know if I agreed, disagreed, or had something to add to its content. 'People of color' would just be a noun phrase and 'are represented' would be the verb phrase in the most stripped-down version of the original author's thesis. It is the words that surround the topical noun phrase that give the piece it's meaning. Do the author's word choices suggest detachment, cynicism, or empathy? How would I show this? Where would the audience land their eyes in the minutes while I unpack my interpretation? I could have the words 'sensitive', 'political', and 'correctness' at contending angles and in contrasting colors to the word 'people'. I could allow the use of uppercase to indicate that 'People' is a group label. What I would be creating would be academic yes, but it would also be a work of art. I would be making new connections and inventions not directly stated by the original author. I would do this by focusing on how and why the original author talks about people of color and their representation.</p>

      <p>The disconnect may be in understanding word-frequency data as a source for research. As such, a scholar would expect it to be reliable and accurate. When it is used in real world examples, that is to say outside of this project, researchers do factor in context. Word frequency programs, not to be confused with word cloud generators, flag stand-out words and complete phrases so the researcher knows where to look for said context. These programs produce bland charts and graphs which researchers use as an industry standard. If they choose to use the less informative but more visually pronounced word cloud, possibly to crossover to another audience, it would not be as a formal report on findings. It would be a remix that contemplates the original author's alternate or deeper meaning and produces new commentary.</p>
