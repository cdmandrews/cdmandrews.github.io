<h2>Guide to getting strong letters of recommendation</h2>
	<p>Requesting a recommendation--specifically, a letter of recommendation to accompany a graduate school or job application--seems like a fairly straightforward process: email the person you would like a recommendation from and ask your ask. But really it's a little trickier than that. This guide is intended to help you help me write the best letter I can for you.</p>
	<p>First, two short articles about <strong>how to cultivate a good letter</strong>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.dearenglishmajor.com/blog/2017/1/4/how-to-get-strong-letters-of-recommendation-from-professors" target="_blank">Paul Corrigan, "How to get strong letters of recommendation from professors”</a></li>
		<li><a a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-recommendation-letter/" target="_blank">Matt Might’s “How to get a great letter of recommendation”</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>How to ask for a letter of recommendation</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Pick your letter-writers well</strong>. Ask someone who knows you beyond the classroom or has some insight into your character/personality and understands what grad school is about.</li>
		<li><strong>Please ask first</strong>. The first time we find out you’ve got us as a recommendation shouldn’t be when we get an automated email from a job or graduate program. Give us a chance to decline.</li>
		<li>Waive rights to read the recommendation</strong>. Somewhere in the automated application system, after you enter names of your recommenders, universities ask you to "Waive right to read the recommendation." Check this box. Most professors will not write a letter without doing so. Some professors (like me) will send you the recommendation letter after they've submitted it, but most will not.</li>
		<li><strong>Give us time</strong>. Ask as soon as possible to give us the time we need. At least 3 weeks, but 2 months is even better. Remember end-of-term is BUSY for professors, so the earlier you ask, the better. </li>
		<li><strong>Give us information</strong>. In the initial request, send us the following: application deadlines, application links, any names and addresses we might need for the letter, and your updated resume/CV.</li>
		<li><strong>Give us a little contex</strong>. We do remember you and sure we’ve seen you on Instagram, but we also have lots of students and may be fuzzy on the kinds of details that make for strong letters. We’ll have to answer things like how long we’ve known you or how many classes we’ve taught you in. Remind us of specific courses you took with us and your particularly excellent projects. Attach your writing sample and personal statement, which will help us write great letters.</li>
		<li><strong>Update us if it’s been a minute</strong>. If it’s been a year or more since we’ve heard from you, provide an update on some of your recent activities. If it's been more than 5 years since you graduated and we haven't kept close touch, consider asking someone else with more recent information. </li>
		<li><strong>Say thank you</strong>. When the letter is sent, you’ll probably get an automated confirmation message. Send us a short thank-you email. It’s polite, and it also helps your favorite faculty document LOR-writing for service in their tenure and promotion materials!</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>How to write the actual request email</h2>
	<p>In this situation, I tend towards a more formal structure and tone, but if you've followed the guidelines in the articles above and have created relationshps with the people you're asking, you <em>know your audience</em> and can use your best judgment. </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Salutation (“Dear Dr. ____,”</li>
		<li>Open with a purpose statement (“I’m writing/emailing to ask…”</li>
		<li>Give the schedule/details (see #5 above)</li>
		<li>Provide some extra context (see #6 above)</li>
		<li>Provide any instructions (i.e. do I email it to someone at the university, or can I expect an email from an automated system?)</li>
		<li>Conclusion (“If you have any questions or need any further information…”)</li>
		<li>Closing (“Sincerely, _____”)</li>
	</ol>

<blockquote>“You write your own letters by the reputation and relationships you build during your years in college. When your professors sit down to type out a recommendation on official letterhead, we just do our best to record in words what you’ve already written with your actions.” (Paul Corrigan)</blockquote>
