			<h2>Accessibility and Course Delivery</h2>
      <p>I work continually to ensure this course’s design, delivery, and policies are as radically <a href="https://webaim.org/" target="_blank">accessible</a> as I can make them. I am here to help you succeed. If you have questions or <a href="#ada">specific accessibility needs</a> that are not being met, I welcome dialogue with you. I work on the basic assumptions of an ethics of care: 1) We’re all people and deserve to be treated like people. 2) Your well-being is important to me. 3) I will do what I can to be flexible and responsive to situations, and ask that you do the same.</p>

      <p>Work in this class is structured into modules on a weekly schedule. This online class is a communal learning experience and not an individualized correspondence course. To learn in this class, you must engage with your co-learners just as much as you engage with the materials we are reading and writing. Because the class is asynchronous you have the flexibility to complete materials at the time of day that best suits you. However, you must still engage meaningfully with the other people in the class. Read more about my guidelines for course community in the “<a href="#conduct">Course Conduct</a>” section of this syllabus. Read the “<a href="#oli">Online Learning Information</a>” section of this syllabus for more information about online learning at TAMU&ndash;CC and in this course.</p>
			
	  		<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
			<p>English 3379 emphasizes practical concepts related to writing and communication on the internet and the World Wide Web. Attention is given to finding and analyzing information, analyzing and designing WWW sites and other digital, hypertextual environments.</p>

			<h2>About the Course</h2>
			<p>This course will expand your toolbox to create effective, usable, and accessible mobile-first content for websites and social media by taking a rhetorical approach to writing for the web. Web design and online publishing are essential and marketable skills for communicators in every field.</p>
			<p>Writing in/with digitally mediated environments—like the web—presents writers with a set of unique textual challenges. It also presents a rich set of opportunities. This course is designed around helping you gain both practical experience and a theoretical perspective for writing in/with rapidly evolving digital technologies. That is, we are going to be working with digital technologies to (re)create content with/in digital conversations. But we are also going to be equipping ourselves with an understanding of why we make the choices we do when we write. This theoretical perspective for writing on the web is vitally important precisely because the digital writing landscape is so varied and rapidly shifting.</p>

			<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
			<p>Students in ENGL 3379 will:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Apply approaches from rhetoric and user experience to develop accessible, mobile-first web content,</li>
				<li>Accommodate the needs of online readers through writing style, structure, and web design,</li>
				<li></li>Learn how literacy, credibility, copyright, and technology affect Web development, and </li>
				<li>Design and/or redesign web projects for audiences using basic software tools, templates, and markup languages such as markdown, HTML, and CSS.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Required Materials</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Letting Go of the Words: Writing Web Content that Works</em> 2nd edition, by Janice Redish. Elsevier, 2012</li>
				<li>Other required readings will be open access on the web, provided by the instructor, or accessible through the Bell Library.</li>
				<li>I will ask you to try a variety of web writing or development tools over the course of the semester. My goal is not for you to become an expert in each of these, but to get your hands dirty and experiment with a variety of web content tools</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Web Accounts and Privacy</h3>
			<p>You will create accounts with one or more web development and publishing tools in this class. These may be public accounts, and thus searchable and potentially scalable: you can't control who finds what, how, and where. To protect your privacy you may create a pseudonym or alias for any account I ask you to use. At the same time, I strongly encourage you to consider the long-term value of establishing these accounts under your own name or a professional alias. Having accounts where you conduct yourself professionally might well be an asset to your online presence, proving to be useful elements of portfolios you might eventually rely on when applying for jobs or schools in the future.</p>
			
			<h2 id="projects">Graded Activities</h2>
			<p>Complete descriptions, requirements, evaluation criteria, and rubrics are available on Blackboard. All projects should respect intellectual property and include APA or another appropriate citation style. I will use the A-F grading scheme as described in the University <em>Catalog</em>.</p>

			<h2>Course Schedule</h2>
			<p><a href="calendar.html">A detailed weekly schedule </a>of readings and assignments is available on our learning management system (LMS). If changes are necessary, I will announce them via email and the LMS.</p>

			<p>Multiple activities are due each week, including blog posts, reflection journal entries, and drafts of major projects, and I’ve scheduled the class roughly as a Tuesday-Thursday (T/R) class. Post discussions and exercises by 11:59 pm on the day they are due.</p>

			<h2 id="conduct">Course Conduct</h2>
			<p>The most important things you can do to get everything you can out of this course:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Engage with your classmates and your instructor</li>
				<li>Keep up with and “attend” the class</li>
				<li>Understand late work and revision policies</li>
				<li>Practice professional communication in email and other communications</li>
				<li>Learn to use our technology</li>
			</ul>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Engaging">Engage with your classmates and instructor</h3>
				<p>In an online course, interacting with your classmates is just as valuable as interacting with the instructor. For us, discussions and chats are primary modes of learning as well as communication with fellow students. Take advantage of discussions, participate in discussion channels in a timely manner, and actually talk TO EACH OTHER rather than just TO ME. Add your opinions to/participate in the discussions, but do so respectfully of the viewpoints and lived experiences of others.</p>

				<p>Work extra hard to get to know other classmates&mdash;they are going through the same material you are, but will bring their diverse experiences to bear on it and you might learn something from them. An online class does not have to be an isolating experience. I will assign you to a discussion group in the course, and you should get to know thoe people. Reach out in Blackboard posts, email, or social media to support each other. If you have good info/tips on what is working for you, on resources, or other ideas, please share with the group so we can help each other out. The class will become its own community of practice, and you will be amazed at how good of a resource your colleagues can be.</p>

				<p class="text-info">FERPA Privacy note: I won’t use any forum other than your university email to ask or talk about grades. Grade discussions are private and should occur with your instructor only.</p>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Attending">Keep up with and “attend” the class</h3>
				<p>There is no synchronous attendance component for this course&mdash;posting blog discussions and other activities on the regular, posted schedule is “attending” class. Work is normally due on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On most weeks, you should plan on working between 6 and 8 hours on course reading and writing activities.</p>
				<p>I expect that you will attend class by logging in 3&mdash;4 times per week, checking recent announcements, reading weekly schedules and instructions, and generally keeping up with assigned work and discussions.</p>
				<p class="text-info">For purposes of reporting non-attendance to the University during grade reporting, I will use the last day you submitted work and not the last time you logged onto Blackboard.</p>

				<p>If you begin assignments early, do so understanding that I’ve organized and scaffolded our weekly activities so that they will help prepare you to complete and be successful on major projects. If you get too far ahead on those, you may end up heading in the wrong direction because you haven’t yet completed a key discussion activity or had a chance to benefit from peer review.</p>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Late work">Understand late work and revision policies</h3>
				<p>Post assignments on time. I am understanding of occasional late work, but this should not be habitual. It is up to you to prioritize learning activities in this class. I do not assign penalties for late work on regular weekly activities and assignments as long as they are turned in within a two-day grace period. However, the later you submit, the less feedback you will receive. After a two-day grace period, I will deduct 10% from regular weekly assignments and discussions</p>

				<p>I am on your side, but you are responsible for you: keep up with your assignments and your grades. I post all grades for you in Blackboard, so all you have to do is regularly check in.</p>

				<p>I accept revisions on major projects, provided that you meet formally with me to discuss feedback on your project, a revision agenda, and a timeline for completion.</p>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Email">Practice professional communication in email</h3>
				<p>Email is an important professional medium, and I assume you will use your university email account for this course.</p>

				<p>As the class is a professional writing course, I expect that you will practice what we’re learning. We will explore this further, but professional email includes a <strong>meaningful subject line</strong>, has a <strong>complete inquiry</strong>, and uses <strong>language appropriate for the writer’s context</strong>.</p>
				<ul class="text-info">
					<li>I will commonly respond to Blackboard or email requests within 24 hours, but you can expect a response within 3 days. I generally do not answer emails over the weekend.</li>
					<li>I will use Announcements on Blackboard each week, which will also send to your Islander email account. You may set up email forwarding if you wish, but you are responsible for checking email. Missing emails is not an excuse for missed work or announcements.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Technology">Learn to use our technology</h3>
				<p>As you might rightly assume, a course titled "Writing for the Web" is entirely imbricated with technology: the class is about technology, you will complete it via technology, and it works because of, as a result of, and in dialogue with technology. Not all of us have the same technical background or relationship with computing and the web, but we all can inhabit the following important attitudes and behaviors important to success with writing for the web:</p>

				<p><strong>Attitude: We learn from failure.</strong> A spirit of inquiry and experiment is just as important as particular technical skills in this course. Showing up with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing up with an excuse, and sometimes we can learn more from your broken website than some slick Squarespace module. Your honest effort is more interesting to me than perfect work.</p>

				<p><strong>Attitude: Learning writing is learning technology.</strong> “Writing is a technology” is not a new idea at all. While I do not expect you to become an expert in HTML5 in fifteen weeks, for example, I do expect you to push beyond your current technical knowledge. The days of separating technical knowledge from literacy knowledge are long past.</p>

				<p><strong>Attitude: Tech happens.</strong> We all have computer difficulties, and must be able to adapt and work around them. There are a handful of things you can do and be proactive about in order to be successful in the course: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>back up your work on the cloud, on Office 365, or on physical media</li>
					<li>practice good file management habits by using folders, subfolders, and meaningful file names</li>
					<li>ensure your technology is updated within your means and the expectations of coursework</li>
					<li>save early and often</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="text-info">TAMUCC provides you free access to Office 365, along with a variety of other software. Use these resources! Visit <a href="http://iol.tamucc.edu">http://iol.tamucc.edu</a> for details.</p>

				<p>Ultimately, you are responsible for your command of technology as well as course content. I will help you do this and provide resources to support you, but if you are having difficulty it is your responsibility to a) ask for help and b) look for tutorials and supplementary material that work for you.</p>

			<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>

				<h3 id="ada">Notice to Students with Disabilities</h3>
				<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. </p>

				<p class="text-info">If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please call or visit Disability Services at (361) 825-5816 in Corpus Christi Hall 116. </p>

				<p class="text-info">If you are a returning veteran and are experiencing cognitive and/or physical access issues in the classroom, or on campus, please contact the Disability Services office for assistance at (361) 825-5816.</p>

				<h3>Statement of Civility</h3>
				<p>Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi has a diverse student population that represents the population of the state. Our goal is to provide you with a high quality educational experience that is free from repression. You are responsible for following the rules of the University, city, state and federal government. We expect that you will behave in a manner that is dignified, respectful and courteous to all people, regardless of sex, ethnic/racial origin, religious background, sexual orientation or disability. Behaviors that infringe on the rights of another individual will not be tolerated.</p>

				<h3>Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty</h3>
				<p>University students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty.  Academic misconduct for which a student is subject to penalty includes all forms of cheating, such as illicit possession of examinations or examination materials, falsification, forgery, complicity or plagiarism. (Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another as one’s own work.)  </p>

				<p>In this class, academic misconduct or complicity in an act of academic misconduct on an assignment or test will result in:</p>
				<ul class="text-info">
					<li>first offense = no credit for assignment</li>
					<li>subsequent offenses = failure of class</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In general terms, students are expected to "demonstrate a high level of maturity, self-direction and ability to manage their own affairs" and to "conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty." Instances of plagiarism will be handled in accordance with Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi General Academic Policies and Regulations as listed in the current catalog.</p>

				<h3>Dropping a Class</h3>
				<p>I hope that you never find it necessary to drop this or any other class.  However, events can sometimes occur that make dropping a course necessary or wise. Please consult with your academic advisor, the Financial Aid Office, and me, before you decide to drop this course.  Should dropping the course be the best course of action, you must initiate the process to drop the course by going to the Student Services Center and filling out a course drop form.  Just stopping attendance and participation WILL NOT automatically result in your being dropped from the class. November 10, 2023, is the last day to drop a class with an automatic grade of “W” this term.</p>

				<h3>Grade Appeal Process</h3>
				<p>As stated in University Procedure 13.02.99.C0.03, Student Grade Appeal Procedures, a student who believes that he or she has not been held to appropriate academic standards as outlined in the class syllabus, equitable evaluation procedures, or appropriate grading, may appeal the final grade given in the course. The burden of proof is upon the student to demonstrate the appropriateness of the appeal.  A student with a complaint about a grade is encouraged to first discuss the matter with the instructor.  For complete details, including the responsibilities of the parties involved in the process and the number of days allowed for completing the steps in the process, see University Procedure 13.02.99.C0.03, Student Grade Appeal Procedures. These documents are accessible through the University Rules Web site at  <a href="https://academicaffairs.tamucc.edu/rules_procedures/index.html.">https://academicaffairs.tamucc.edu/rules_procedures/index.html</a>. For assistance and/or guidance in the grade appeal process, students may contact the Dean’s office in the college in which the course is taught or the Office of the Provost.</p>

				<h3>Statement of Academic Continuity</h3>
				<p>In the event of an unforeseen adverse event, such as a major hurricane, and classes could not be held on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University–Corpus Christi; this course would continue through the use of Blackboard and/or email. In addition, the syllabus and class activities may be modified to allow continuation of the course. Ideally, University facilities (i.e., emails, web sites, and Blackboard) will be operational within two days of the closing of the physical campus. However, students need to make certain that the course instructor has a primary and a secondary means of contacting each student.</p>

				<h3>Academic Advising</h3>
				<p>The College of Liberal Arts requires that students meet with an Academic Advisor as soon as they are ready to declare a major. Degree plans are prepared in the CLA Academic Advising Center using DegreeWorks. Any amendment must be approved by the Department Chair and the Office of the Dean. All courses and requirements specified in the final degree plan audit must be completed before a degree will be granted.</p>
				
				<h3>Civil Rights Reporting</h3>
				<p>Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi is committed to fostering a culture of caring and respect that is free from discrimination, relationship violence and sexual misconduct, and ensuring that all affected students have access to services.  For information on reporting Civil Rights complaints, options and support resources (including pregnancy support accommodations) or university policies and procedures, please contact the University Title IX Coordinator, Sam Ramirez at Samuel.ramirez@tamucc.edu or Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Rosie Ruiz at Rosie.Ruiz@tamucc.edu ext. 5826, or visit website at Title IX/Sexual Assault/Pregnancy.</p><p>Limits to confidentiality.  Essays, journals, and other materials submitted for this class are generally considered confidential pursuant to the University's student record policies.  However, students should be aware that University employees, including instructors, are not able to maintain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report alleged or suspected civil rights discrimination that is observed by or made known to an employee in the course and scope of their employment.  As the instructor, I must report allegations of civil rights discrimination, including sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, or sexual harassment to the Title IX Coordinator if you share it with me. These reports will trigger contact with you from the Civil Rights/Title IX Compliance office who will inform you of your options and resources regarding the incident that you have shared.  If you would like to talk about these incidents in a confidential setting, you are encouraged to make an appointment with counselors in the University Counseling Center.</p>


			<h2 id="oli">Online Learning Information</h2>
			<p>Online courses give you a great deal of flexibility, but also require computing, communication, and organization skills that may not be emphasized in face-to-face courses. Online courses emphasize active learning and regular contact with your instructor and other students. Find more information about Online Learning at <a href="http://iol.tamucc.edu">http://iol.tamucc.edu</a></p>
