The link above is a *short* video with feedback (from me) about your fact sheet. I kept the five-minute Screencastify auto-cutoff--that's both to keep things moving for myself (there's lots of you and one of me) and to keep things moving for you (you don't want to hear me yammer on for ten minutes, I promise...). Your recording may chop me off mid-word, but that's usually a good thing! I'm probably repeating myself. I am trying out video feedback for the first time this semester--please let me know if it works for you.
If for some reason your link doesn't work, email me and I'll re-send it to you. Also, if you have follow-up questions, please send them my way. We'll do another round of peer review and feedback this week, so keep on working!
(Also, as I mentioned in announcements and weekly notes, the "grade" for peer review is based on participation, not how rough or refined your draft is! If you posted a draft AND reviewed two other folks' stuff, that's full credit. If you only posted a draft, it's only partial credit.
