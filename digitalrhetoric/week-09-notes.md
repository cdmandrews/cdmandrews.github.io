## What to do for Week 09:

1. Work on your things. At the end of our workshop, your revised CSS and HTML markup for your profile site will be due. To "submit," email me a link to your materials with a note signifying where you're at, what you think, and how you feel like the site represents your work in the course thus far.

2. We will also have to make our plan for the final (!) portion of the course. Options include:
  - Collaborating on a webtext publication that works with and refines the materials you put together for the distant reading project. See [notes/proposal](ideas).
  - Special topics in Digital Rhetoric: an exploration of topics and ideas in digital rhetoric based on or inspired by the results of your distant reading project. The major product here would be a webtext-format annotated bibliography.


3. We also have some clean-up to do; in emphasizing our workshop the last few weeks, we have (necessarily) sidelined discussion of topics in Brooke chapters 4-8 and other assigned texts. In order to structure our discussion of those materials, you will need to do the following:
  - From our assigned texts from the last few weeks, extract a handful of core ideas or critical passages that you think we should discuss. Extract ideas/passages from Brooke *any two* of the other articles (Haas, Porter, Ridolfo & Devoss, and Lambke).
  - Come up with 5 questions for us to take up based on those readings. Questions may be specific to a particular text, or may work across and among texts to generate rich connections. They could be theoretical or practical in nature--and double-plus brownie points if they can draw on our experiences creating and marking up portfolios.
  - Submit your passages/questions to me by email (a link to a page on your profile site is fine) on or before November 4.
