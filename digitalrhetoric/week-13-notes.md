# "Handout" for Week 13

[ENGL 5369, Fall 2019](calendar.html)

[Slides if you want such things](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRufA94YIvpbFkJ2K591QOVPqCeLM5nAcGgkbJ0uiCuOgYeWh5OUR1FXmLTWgReyHFb8yPoLY4kWyb5/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

[Everyone's sites so far](fambly)

## To do for today:

You should have:   
  - **Written about your "from"**:
  - **Written about your "method" for creating your word clouds**:
  - **Written more broadly about "What am I interested in?" with these word clouds.**:

So let's see what you've got.

Weird [pouf of concept](tagcloud/tagcloud-index.html)

* regularize (?) or make methodical our distant readings
* do an appropriate lit. review or writeup with  
  - topics we're wanting to focus on
  - other research and abstracting of key texts for distant reading, digital rhetoric, other topics?
  - what are our conclusions? (are there conclusions?)
* plan a design and multimodal argument
  - new word clouds: Suggested to use TagCloud, which will create accessible and uniform text versions (rather than images of text versions) of word clouds. If concerned with size, be sure to use "upload files" rather than copy/paste.

## To do for next time:
 - I encourage *rest* over the break, but I will certainly answer emails over the weeks to come. It'll be a bit before we see one another again!
 - **Revise, refine, reword. Get your text formatted as plaintext or markdown for conversion to HTML.**
 - **Work on "new" word clouds?**
 - **Come with ideas about design** In class next time (week 15!) we'll get something framed out if we can.

 Who will do markup? Who will copyedit the markup? Who will work on design? Who will copyedit text? Prepare references?


### The plan for the next few weeks:
  - **Week 13**: Bring written material (see "to-do" list above) for analysis/discussion and tracing of key themes/nodes. Workshopping. Writing. Check out the [Kairos Style Guide](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/styleguide.html). Refine ideas for [site structure](https://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/3-site-structure.html) and define next steps to make/include/remake word clouds.
  - **Week 14**: Rest for the break. Work on "new" word clouds and revise a little bit. Take pictures of your doggos, kittehs, sneks, or stuffies.
  - **Week 15**: Work on interface/design/site structure for webtext. Workshopping. Writing. Trying not to freak out in unhealthy ways.
  - **Week 16**: Revise, revise, revise. Probably more design work and troubleshooting. See if we can have a rough draft of the webtext done, to be submitted in the coming weeks. Define individual production roles and relationships as we head into the murk of "when the semester's over and we're moving on to other things."
