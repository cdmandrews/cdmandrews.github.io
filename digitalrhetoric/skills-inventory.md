## Your inventories

## Instructions

This short assignment is to help you practice your Markdown chops--i.e. to focus on *writing* for the web--and move us transitionally to HTML tags and more advanced work in markup languages.

This .md file contains the raw (and rough) text of the skills inventory we did during class Aug. 28. Copy or download this file. Delete the instructions (the first thirty lines or so), and then use Markdown syntax to create a formatted version of the skills inventory. You can mark up and structure the inventory information any way you see fit, with a few requirements. Your inventory should include:

- at least two levels of headings
- one or more lists
- one or more links
- bold or italic to indicate emphasis

Tables, images, blockquotes, and anything else are up to you. Revise your own information if you've thought of other things to add or if I added something incorrectly.

Before next Wednesday at noon, email  your .md file to me as an attachment. Use the file name: yourname-inventory.md  (so, nicole-inventory.md, etc.) I'll put them online and we'll inspect them together.

## Resources

A tool I intended to mention Wednesday and forgot: You can use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) to work on Markdown files in a browser if you want. Handy, as you can have  markdown mode and reader mode open at the same time.

During class, you completed the tutorial at [https://www.markdowntutorial.com/](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). You can also find a variety of other tutorials, references, and specs for Markdown on the web:
- [CommonMark.org](https://commonmark.org/help)
- [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [John Gruber's original spec](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)
