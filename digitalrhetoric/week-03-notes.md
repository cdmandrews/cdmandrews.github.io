- [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
The relationship between the W3C and WHATWG is complex. Both organizations collaborated to develop HTML5, but haven't always played nicely since. WHATWG publishes the "living standard" while W3C versioned their standards (up to HTML5.2). In 2019, W3C agreed to work with the WHATWG living standard rather than just forking WHATWG's work. (Lots of politics there, and a great reminder that **technology and its development ain't neutral**; [read if you're curious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#W3C_and_WHATWG_conflict)) You can read about some history of development standards and recommendations in Stolley, *How to*, Chapter 4 .


- [Mozilla Developer Network Web Docs: HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)
MDN Web Docs is an excellent reference and resource for all aspects of web development. Look up elements and attributes, get tutorials, and troubelshoot problems.


- [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/)
A website "for people who make websites." Not helpful if you're stuck on how a partiuclar element works, but great if you want to read up on a variety of topics relevant to web standards and the "design, development, and meaning of web content."

## Links for accessibility and usability

- [W3C Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/)
The World Wide Web Consortium is an international community that develops Web standards. This intro to accessibility is a solid one, but is more from the working group's developer/standards perspecive.


- [WebAIM Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://webaim.org/intro/)
WebAIM is a nonprofit  organization that focuses on training and analysis of web content. Also of note is their [accessibility analysis of the top million home pages](https://webaim.org/projects/million/)


- [usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/)
This site is a resource for usability practices and guidelines, managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

- [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/)
Jakob Nielsen and Don Norman defined usability and the field of UX. The NN/g website is an excellent resource for user experience. Like, I can't even say how important these two guys are.

## What to do for Week 04:

1. Wednesday will be a practical-oriented day:
  - workshopping and validating your three HTML pages (home page, cv/resume page, and something else), we'll talk semantics and validation in particular (revisit necessary sections of Stolley in prep for this)
  - play with distant reading methods in preparation for distant reading project.

2. Read Eyman 3 and Mueller 3 (linked in both BB9 and on the web). Mueller's chapter will help flesh out your undestanding of "distant reading", a research method we'll play with for the [Distant reading project](assignments.html). Important questions and methods for us to consider tomorrow:
  - what is a research method? a methodology? (I'll shoot some recommended readings your way to help with this question.)
  - what methods does the field of digital rhetoric use to take into account the complications of the affordances of digital practices?
  - close reading
  - distant reading
  - genre studies
  - usability studies
