    <p>This course overviews digital rhetoric: an interdisciplinary field offering scholars, teachers, and makers an array of theories, methods, and practices for working with digital texts. We will <strong>survey scholarship in digital rhetoric</strong> and explore the relevance of that work for composition teaching and professions in writing and technical communication. You will <strong>practice digital research methods</strong> such as distant reading to develop a research project on a topic of your choosing. You will also add to your technical and rhetorical skills to <strong>evaluate and compose accessible and usable digital texts</strong>, including building your own personal or professional profile/portfolio site.</p>
    <p>The course will have a heavy workshop emphasis, and we will spend part of every class meeting working on your projects in development.</p>

    <p><strong>Catalog description for 5362:</strong> Studies in the theory and practice of electronic research, writing and editing. Includes topics that relate to academic scholarship and contemporary writing instruction within electronic settings.</p>

    <li>We will work with a variety of cloud-based and other software as the class finds its own direction—a spirit of tinkering and figuring things out is a valuable required material. See <a href="#resources">resources</a> for more information.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>General graduate student expectations</h2>
  <p>Bona fide graduate-school behavior is distinguished in at least five ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Students read assignments on time, completely, to the last page, and come to class with serious responses and a willingness to discuss them.</li>
    <li>Students do not assume that an assignment is legitimate only if it is graded. The work is done for its own learning value.</li>
    <li>Students expect to attend every class, and make home arrangements to ensure that this happens.</li>
    <li>Students approach all readings and coursework with an open mind and a spirit of curiosity. They work  to understand ideas and texts prior to attacking or dismissing them.</li>
    <li>Students assume that open and equitable discussion is the soul of a graduate seminar. Everyone participates. Rather than expecting the professor or other students to originate or maintain discussion, students take on the responsibility to contribute their share.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Grading and assignments</h2>
    <p>I will use the following percentages to calculate your course grade, and will use the grading system as described in the TAMU-CC <em>Catalog</em>. If you have questions about grades or grading throughout the semester, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p>
    <p>Full descriptions of each project may be found at <a href="assignments.html">assignments.html</a></p>

  <h3>Reading discussions and course participation</h3>
    <p>Your active participation in our class discussions is required both for your own success in the class, and for the success of the class as a whole. I do not give reading quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading and expect you to be ready to discuss and apply that reading during class meetings. Class meetings will be workshop oriented—you should come to class each week prepared to develop current projects, get feedback from your instructor, and work with your colleagues on relevant production tasks.</p>

  <h3>Late work</h3>
    <p>Assignments are due on the dates listed on the syllabus unless for some reason I announce a change or unless you have made special arrangements with me. Work turned in after that time will be penalized 10% per day. I will not accept major assignments more than five days late. Hard drive crashes and other computer problems will not be accepted as excuses for late work. Back up your materials.</p>

  <h2>Course Policies</h2>

  <h3>Disability services</h3>
    <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities.  Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities.  If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please call or visit Disability Services at (361) 825-5816 in Corpus Christi Hall, Room #116.</p>
    <p>If you are a returning veteran and are experiencing cognitive and/or physical access issues in the classroom or on campus, please contact the Disability Services office for assistance at (361) 825-5816.</p>

  <h3>Statement of civility</h3>
    <p>Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi has a diverse student population that represents the population of the state. Our goal is to provide you with a high-quality educational experience that is free from repression. You are responsible for following the rules of the University, city, state and federal government. We expect that you will behave in a manner that is dignified, respectful and courteous to all people, regardless of sex, ethnic/racial origin, religious background, sexual orientation or disability. Behaviors that infringe on the rights of another individual will not be tolerated.</p>

    <h3>Technology </h3>
      <p>As you might rightly assume, a course titled "Digital Rhetoric” is entirely imbricated with technology: the class is about technology, and it works because of, as a result of, and in dialogue with technology. This means a handful of things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tech happens.</strong> Difficulty with your computer or technology is not an acceptable excuse for late work, whether those are reading responses or one of our major projects. Practice agency by backing up your work, ensuring your technology is updated within your means and the expectations of coursework, and saving early & often.</li>
        <li><strong>You should learn something new about digital technology. </strong>While I do not expect you to become an expert in HTML5 in fifteen weeks, for example, I do expect you to push beyond your current technical knowledge. The days of separating technical knowledge from literacy knowledge are long past. Ultimately, you are responsible for your command of technology as well as course content. I will help you do this and provide resources to support you, but if you are having difficulty it is your responsibility to a) ask for help and b) look for tutorials and supplementary material that work for you (this is but one small example of an important idea, a “rhetoric of personal agency,” which we’ll talk about during the term).</li>
        <li><strong>Learn from failure. </strong>A spirit of inquiry and experiment is just as important as particular technical skills in this course. "Showing up" with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing up with an excuse, and sometimes we can learn more from your broken webtext than some slick Squarespace module. Your honest effort is more interesting to me than perfect work.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Social accounts and privacy</h3>
      <p>We may use social accounts for this class. These are public accounts, and thus searchable and scalable: you can't control who finds what, how, and where. To protect your privacy you may create a pseudonym or alias any account we use. At the same time, I strongly encourage you to consider the long-term value of establishing these accounts under your own name or a professional alias. Having accounts where you conduct yourself professionally might well be an asset to your online presence, proving to be useful elements of portfolios you might eventually rely on when applying for jobs or schools in the future.</p>

  <h3>Academic dishonesty</h3>
    <p>University students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty. Academic misconduct for which a student is subject to penalty includes all forms of cheating, such as illicit possession of examinations or examination materials, falsification, forgery, complicity or plagiarism. (Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another as one’s own work.) In this class, academic misconduct or complicity in an act of academic misconduct on an assignment or test will result in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>first offense ⇒ no credit for assignment</li>
      <li>subsequent offenses ⇒ failure of class</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Dropping a course</h3>
    <p>I hope that you never find it necessary to drop this or any other class. However, events can sometimes occur that make dropping a course necessary or wise. Please consult with your academic advisor, the Financial Aid Office, and me, before you decide to drop this course. Should dropping the course be the best course of action, you must initiate the process to drop the course by going to the Student Services Center and filling out a course drop form. Just stopping attendance and participation WILL NOT automatically result in your being dropped from the class. The last day to drop a class is Friday, November 8, 2019.</p>

  <h3>Grade appeals process</h3>
    <p>As stated in University Procedure 13.02.99.C2.03, Student Grade Appeal Procedures, a student who believes that he or she has not been held to appropriate academic standards as outlined in the class syllabus, equitable evaluation procedures, or appropriate grading, may appeal the final grade given in the course. The burden of proof is upon the student to demonstrate the appropriateness of the appeal.  A student with a complaint about a grade is encouraged to first discuss the matter with the instructor.</p>
    <p>For complete details, including the responsibilities of the parties involved in the process and the number of days allowed for completing the steps in the process, see <a href="http://academicaffairs.tamucc.edu/rules_procedures/assets/13.02.99.C0.03_student_grade_appeals.pdf">University Procedure 13.02.99.C2.03, Student Grade Appeal Procedures</a>.</p>
    <p>For complete details on the process of submitting a formal grade appeal, please visit the College of Liberal Arts website, <a href="http://cla.tamucc.edu/about/student-resources.html">"Student Resources"</a>.</p>
    <p>For assistance and/or guidance in the grade appeal process, students may contact the Associate Dean’s Office.</p>

  <h3>Academic advising</h3>
    <p>The College of Liberal Arts requires that students meet with an Academic Advisor as soon as they are ready to declare a major.  Degree plans are prepared in the CLA Academic Advising Center. The University uses an online Degree Audit system.  Any amendment must be approved by the Department Chair and the Office of the Dean. All courses and requirements specified in the final degree plan audit must be completed before a degree will be granted.  The CLA Academic Advising Office is located in Driftwood #203.  For more information please call 361-825-3466.</p>

  <h3>Academic continuity</h3>
    <p>In the event of an unforeseen adverse event, such as a major hurricane and classes could not be held on the campus of Texas A&M University–Corpus Christi; this course would continue through the use of Blackboard and/or email. In addition, the syllabus and class activities may be modified to allow continuation of the course. Ideally, University facilities (i.e., emails, web sites, and Blackboard) will be operational within two days of the closing of the physical campus. However, students need to make certain that the course instructor has a primary and a secondary means of contacting each student.</p>
