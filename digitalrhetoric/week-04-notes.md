## Method: Digital Rhetoric

>"digital writing research should not be viewed merely as research about writing with technology. It should be viewed, rather, as changing the fundamental assumptions about methodology, particularly the humanist assumption that divides the human from the technological. Digital writing research takes a cyborgian view and a networked view of human communications.... it represents a new way of looking altogether.‚Äù (Foreword to <cite>Digital Writing Research</cite>, p. xv)

1. Questions worth our time:
  - what is a research method? a methodology?
  - what methods does the field of digital rhetoric use to take into account the complications of the affordances of digital practices?
  - close reading
  - distant reading
  - genre studies
  - usability studies
  - others?
  - study of writing-as-action vs writing-as-context


2. Key bits from Mueller:
  - word watcher
  - network sense
  - distant and thin methods
  - paratactically vs syntactically
  -


2. Some distant readings:
  - [Know your meme](https://youtu.be/k6vHHxWWT0Y)

4. Feeling super-codey? [MassMine](http://www.massmine.org/index.html)


## Praxis: Continue with HTML
 Workshop, [validate](https://validator.w3.org/), and problem solve your (at least three) HTML pages. Do a little show-and-tell.

[Bite, snack, meal](http://www.ewriteonline.com/bite-snack-and-meal-how-to-feed-content-hungry-site-visitors/) as essential approach to web writing.
