## Digital Rhetoric and DIY Websites

**So. You built a thing. Well, where you at? What you think? How you feel like it represents your work in the course thus far?**

In case you forgot, we were **lo-fi**(ing) our way through this by taking "an opportunity to shrug off the burden of opaque software [for digital production] and to focus instead on the medium of production itself" (Stolley 2016) We haven't been zealous about things like package managers and network protocols, but we have tried to work with human-readable and standards-compliant computer languages using plain text files and editors.

Let's get back at [Stolley (2016)](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/) as a way of (re)framing our experiences and lessons thus far. In fact, you should just go ahead and read the Preamble to his webtext.

*I'll wait.*

Lo-fi is:

- **Learning**: "the full range of problems comprising any consequential act of production is unlikely to be satisfactorily addressed by the content or timescale of any one course, book, or tutorial"

- **Openness**: "components of a digital work must be available for inspection, revision, and extension outside the scope of any one device, platform, or piece of production software and any one creator"

- **Flexibility**: "research and imaginative problem-solving as the central means to reach diverse audiences equipped with an endless variety of conventional, mobile, and assistive devices"

- **Iteration**: "the hefty investment in learning something new is rivaled only by the investment of time in creating the first draft of a digital project, regardless of how far short it falls of the idea that originally inspired it"


Also, this quick refresher on the major points in Stolley's manifesto:

1. Software is a poor organizing principle for digital production.
2. Expression should not be trapped by production technologies.
3. Value research and learning over intuition and reflex.
4. Design first for the most constrained users and devices.
5. If a hi-fi element seems necessary, keep researching until you conclude that it isnâ€™t.
6. Version control. Always. Everywhere. For everything.

So, I ask again: <span style="color:red;"> **You built a thing. Where you at? What you think? How you feel like it represents your work in the course thus far?** </span>

Or, we can walk this question out in a different way: **How does the kind of material engagement we've been practicing with HTML and CSS and these websites help you think about how you engage with or learned to engage with media you're much more familiar and skilled with?**

Or, **How does the HTML/CSS work you've been doing over the last ten weeks make you think about:**

 - writing,
 - medium,
 - representation,
 - materiality,
 - technique,
 - learning,
 - literacy,
 - design,
 - production,
 - rhetoric (and rhetorical ecologies),
 - making or crafting,
 - initiation,
 - form and function and meaning,
 - work and making things work,
 - failure and success,
 - mess and order,
 - experimentation and expertise,
 - play and novice-hood,
 - digital life,
 - problem-solving?

## Plan that thang

Ya'll all decided to collaborate on a webtext that works with and refines the materials you put together for the distant reading project. Some things we need to do:

* divide and conquer
* poke around and [look at some webtexts](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/)
* regularize our distant readings
* do an appropriate lit. review or writeup with  
 - Mueller & word-watching
 - Relevant concepts from Brooke, Eyman, etc
 - topics we're wanting to focus on
* plan a design and multimodal argument

## What to do for next week:

We have some backup work to do. By emphasizing our workshop the last few weeks, we have (necessarily) sidelined discussion of topics in Brooke chapters 4-8 and other assigned texts. In order to structure our discussion of those materials, you will need to do the following:
  - From our assigned texts from the last few weeks, extract a handful of core ideas or critical passages that you think we should discuss. Extract ideas/passages from Brooke and *any two* of the other articles (Haas, Porter, Ridolfo & Devoss, Lambke, etc.).

  - Come up with 5 questions for us to take up based on those readings. Questions may be specific to a particular text, or may work across and among texts from throughout the semeseter-so-far to generate rich connections. They could be theoretical or practical in nature--and double-plus brownie points if they can draw on our experiences creating and marking up portfolios or our other digital projects.

  - Submit your passages/questions to me by email (a link to a page on your profile site is fine) on or before November 4.

We will also start/continue work on our webtext project.
