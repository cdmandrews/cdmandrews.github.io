## Digital rhetoric: Theory ketchup

The politics of an interface: an ecological analysis of WYSIWYG (er, Sway, Spark, etc.)
How do interfaces afford or enable some forms of rhetorical action at the same time that they foreclose others?  Agency and WYSIWYG interfaces  (sorta?)
- what is the rhetoric of WYSIWYG?
- what is the value of WYSIWYG?
- what are the limitations of WYSIWYG?
- how do WYSIWYG interfaces enable rhetorical action? how do they foreclose them?

Where do we sit on the continuum of “in praise of difficulty” (i.e. expertise and learning) or low-bar entry (i.e. ease for learners). Should learning be easy or hard? (Is that even the right question?)

On the one side, we have the “material-cultural challenges of circulation” as a constraint, on the other, we have the notion that “literacy” is about expertise with language and culture.

1. Invention (proairesis)
  - Invention is distributed, “a practice that constantly generates points of departure for further acts of rhetorical invention”
  - How or what does an interface make open, make possible?
2. Arrangement (pattern)
  - Arrangement as sequence, pattern, database, “attempts to communicate affinities, connections, and relationships”
  - What structures or sequences are afforded? What practices does an interface make possible?
3. Style (perspective)
  - at/through/from; style is a structuring of perspective
  - How much agency does the rhetor have in design, stemming from what? How rich or not are multimedia choices?
4. Memory (persistence):
  - Persistence as a memory practice is the ability to build and maintain patterns although those patterns may be tentative and ultimately fade into the background.” (157)
  - Can rhetors write from a database? How much database-writing is facilitated?
5. Delivery (performance)
  - not simply “delivery as in pizza” but “delivery as in communicating the message in such a way that it would be accepted and attended to rather than refused, ignored, or thrown in the wastepaper basket unread”
  - Can you deliver? Where? How? Can audiences use it, get to it? (see also velocity)
6. Velocity (power)
  - strategize about the potential recomposition and redistribution of a text
  - What factors (intrinsic and external) might motivate or dissuade third parties from recomposing/redistributing? Are distribution/recomposition desirable, undesirable, or of no concern?

passages
> 1. “A second problem with this approach is more pragmatic, and it is one that opens onto the broader themes of my own project. Landow’s book is relatively unique among volumes of new media criticism in that, in addition to critical accounts, he attempts a corresponding description of what he describes as ‘rhetoric and stylistics.’ However, we would be hard put to find such consistency between the principles he advocates in response to the question ‘How Should We Write Hypertext?’ (the subtitle of this section) and those he celebrates in his readings of various examples throughout his work. Continuing with the example of guyer, and in stark contrast to the rhizome, Landow’s (1997) account of the ‘rhetoric’ of linking is largely rule-based. Arguing that “the very existence of links conditions the reader to expect purposeful, important relationships between linked materials” (p. 125). Landow identifies four “rhetorics” that govern linking - orientation, navigation, departure, and arrival - all of which imply the purposeful relationships that he asserts as intrinsic to links. But these “rhetorics” bear little resemblance to Deleuze and Guattari’s (1987) rhizome, the idea that Landow alludes to in the subtitle for his discussion of Guyer. Unlike the link driven by utility and scarcity, the rhizome, for Deleuze and Guattari, is mush less orderly.” - Brooke pg. 14

> 2. “We introduce a new conceptual consideration in this webtext, what Jim Ridolfo has called “rhetorical velocity,” and we explore the rhetorical possibilities of composing for strategic recomposition. **We propose that the field needs an even greater lexicon to explain the sort of rhetorical moves made by increasingly complex strategies of delivery**.

> 3. In professional writing, an archetypical example of this sort of strategizing is the press advisory and media release—a document specifically and deliberately strategized by a writer or writers with inventive considerations conscious of third-party recomposing. We chose a press release design for this article because it is distributed as analog and digital, with specific strategic use and importance associated with each of these physicalities; it also demonstrates an implicit consideration and structure for its recomposition. Certainly, a press release is not the flashiest or most compelling example of rhetorical velocity in digital spaces, but we think this genre is a useful place to begin thinking about **the strategic appropriation of compositions**. This genre, though constrained by rigid formatting conventions, offers a useful starting point for thinking about how such strategizing may predate and also change shape with the widespread adaptation of digital composing literacies. Additionally, this genre—with its disposition to alphabetic text—offers quick, easily locatable research examples for discussion and comparison (see the Defense Department example we've included elsewhere in this webtext). This genre scaffolds well into classroom conversations, and challenges students and researchers to find, argue for, and discuss other instances and mediums where ideas change shape, gather speed, and are elsewhere delivered.” - Ridolfo and DeVoss (2009)

> 4. “This essay traces a counterstory to Western claims to the origins of hypertext and multimedia by remembering how **American Indian communities have employed wampum belts as hypertextual technologies - as wampum belts have extended human memories of inherited knowledges through interconnected, nonlinear designs and associative storage and retrieval methods - long before the “discovery’”of Western hypertext**. By forging intellectual trade routes between Tehanetorens, Wallace, Williams, and other wampum historians with the work of Western hypertext theorists, such as Bush, Nelson, Bolter, and Landow, this essay positions **American Indians as the first known skilled multimedia workers and intellectuals in the Americas**. Thus wampum has the potential to re-vision the intellectual history of technology, hypertext, and multimedia studies, and thereby American Indian studies - and such a re-visioning calls for a **responsibility to digital and visual rhetorical sovereignty**.” - Haas (2007) pg. 77-78

> 5. “Given the preceding origin story, I posit that **the “history” of hypertext is a Western frontier story**, a narrative that most often begins with the exploration of the land of Xanadu and the Memex and eventually leads to the trailblazing of the World Wide Web. Few stories have been told of hypertexts that existed in Native American territories long before the land of Memex and Xanadu. Consequently this essay offers a preliminary hypertextual historiographical decolonial narrative that suggests that the concept of hypertext and the rhetorical work it does are not new - nor is it unique to Western culture, despite the terminology’s Western etymology (hyper + text; see fig. 5). To accomplish this goal, this essay demonstrates how wampum is an example of a pre-Memex, pre-Xanadu, and pre-Internet American Indian technology that was not only imagined but became a reality and that not only works like hypertext but in fact extends those capabilities beyond the current capacity of interconnected hypertexts we see on the ‘World Wide’ Web.” - Haas (2007) pg. 82-33

> 6. “**In order to retrieve the encoded communication, an individual must be a part of the community with the cultural context for accurate retrieval of that information**. The messages are spoken and woven into the wampum, and those messages are repeated each time an individual (re)presents the material rhetoric, or wampum hypertext, to the community. Thus, in this way, wampum hypertext is more similar to Bush’s vision for hypertext, one that is culturally situation among a community of heritage and cultural knowledge workers. Thus **the hypertext is seen more as a cross-community hypertext than as a global or mass communication**, like Nelson’s vision of hypertext.” Haas (2007) pg. 86

questions
- Based on these passages, how would you interpret the term **hypertext**?
- How does Haas’s examination of wampum make you **reimagine rhetoric**?
- How would you apply the terms “rhetorical velocity” and the four rhetorics governing linking to wampum?
- How might these passages change the way you examine digital rhetoric?
- **How might you connect these passages with the work we have done in class**?

Arrangement/Pattern
> “According to David Weinberger (2002), the first step in acknowledging the different space(s) of the Web is to shed the metaphor of the container. ‘Real-world space is a pre-existing container in which the things of the world exist,’ he explains. ‘Web space is created by the things in it’” (Brooke p. 95).

- Note: I would disagree with Weinberger’s (2002) distinction between real/digital in terms of the real existing as a sort of a priori, acontextual container that orders the things in it. I’d extend the description of the digital, the “web space,” to include the “real world.” For some reason, this notion of the noumenalistic (looking at you, Kant) virtual is still pervasive. Why do we continue to conceptualize space that is not immediately recognizable materially in a way that is **increasingly instrumental, uncertain, and reduced to teleologically to tool, mode, and end-goal**? Attention to telos vs. form/techne (latter as becoming).

> “Many weblogs now feature tagclouds, but often the clouds only reflect a portion of the blogger’s activity, such as keywords from the last 3 months’ worth of entries. Such a cloud, then, would change along with the blog, reflecting changes in its author’s priorities over time and introducing new readers to [them]” (Brooke p. 112).

> “...this practice [word clouds] also can be considered in terms of memory because it allows bloggers to see patterns that they are enacting, whether consciously or not” (Brooke p. 112).

- I’m not hot on blog clouds, but I do find **Brooke’s idea of using word clouds on a personal level valuable as a pattern-sensing tool and heuristic device**. What if we used tag clouds for our own body of work (either the totality of our undergrad, select texts we’ve produced in other coursework, or sources we’ve been using/visiting) as graduate students? How could our construction of word clouds reveal our own interests or goals, and possibly guide us to make connections or pose questions based on our previous work? What if we made these personal word clouds and compared them to our distant reading clouds, and noticed connections with our own interests/goals? What questions could we pose to ourselves as persons viewing scholarly journals and discourse communities from afar, as well as ourselves as users of writing developing our scholarly identities? Through memory of previous work in connection to current work?

- And because I like double-brownies: What if we **remixed/rearranged our classmates’ word clouds using our own approach(es)**? What if we did this to our classmates’ sites? What if we as a class detailed our individual approaches and had each other apply our approaches to remix our sites (CSS, HTML) and word clouds?**

Style/Perspective
> “...one of the things that new media interfaces do stylistically is to help us **move from the abstracted, single perspective of the reader of a static text or the viewer of a painting to the multiple and partial perspectives necessary for many forms of new media**” (p. 114).

> “The ability to pore over a static document … and identify specific features presumes both a catalog of **preexisting rhetorical features that can be isolated, as well as a static object from which one can achieve critical distance**” (p. 115).

> “Perspective is a method for displaying three-dimensional objects and/or scenes on a two-dimensional space. Much like the technology of writing exteriorizes the reader, perspective presumes a viewer whose physical position mirrors the vanishing point” (p. 120).

> “...**interfaces position us perceptually** and … our sensual experiences of interfaces are often as customizable as our hermeneutic approaches to them” (p. 140).

- Thinking about our HTML/CSS website design experiences here. **If we’re not careful practitioners of a digital rhetoric that re-envisions the classical canons ecologically, then we might perceive our HTML/CSS experiences along the linear movement and definition from HTML as “content” resulting from invention, to CSS as “style/form” resulting from the remaining “lesser” canons. To unravel this dichotomy and consider our website/profile/portfolio design using Brooke’s ecology of practice, what can we say about how our choices for HTML affected CSS choices, and vice versa? How did our interactions with HTML and CSS engage us in ways simultaneously inventive (proairetically and hermeneutically) and in terms of pattern/arrangement, style/perspective, memory/persistence, delivery/performance?** In terms of style/perspective, in what ways is the design of our sites, understood through the notion of interface rather than page, mediated by our discovery of blindspots/vanishing points, of alternate viewing points and user values beyond our own?

Ridolfo and DeVoss (2009)
> “The term rhetorical velocity, as we deploy it in this webtext, means a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party. In thinking about the concept, we drew from several definitions:
Rapidity or speed of motion; swiftness.
Physics: A vector quantity whose magnitude is a body's speed and whose direction is the body's direction of motion.
The rate of speed of action or occurrence.”

- What does it mean to theorize velocity as power? Power is simultaneously kinetic and potential. I’m thinking of velocity in terms of electricity, a metaphor Bakhtin uses in Marxism and the Philosophy of Language to suggest, I say, toward a triadic conception of language use in ongoing activity. What about power, as Berthoff says when talking about writing not as a single skill but a complex activity, as **allatonceness**? In terms of electrical, there’s voltage (push), ohms (resistance), and amperage (flow). I think the velocity Ridolfo and DeVoss (2009) are advocating describes all three at once, rather than just a reductive view of power=voltage as push. I think this is because reducing power to push (into being) suggests a linear progression toward some fixed end. I think rhetorical velocity can best be described, using the definitions above, as **paying attention to movement between time-space through circulation and distribution networks (also in flux); the materiality of exigencies, or the tending-toward of actors/actants in various states of becoming mediated by material contexts which are themselves mediated by these networks of becoming; and experiences of these rhetorical interactions, or the mediating affect (speed) of immediate action itself**.

- What does this all mean for our word cloud projects? Well, I think considering velocity in my reading of Ridolfo and DeVoss (2009) means that **our word clouds can be understood as a) artifacts of the distribution and circulation and remix of previous knowledge practices, both in terms of us as grad students in a course, and in the journals as aggregates of scholarly discourse; b) subject to a further state of becoming through continued direction, in our case further use-value beyond our initial looking; and c) mediators of our experience in grad school, in the discipline, in our research interests, etc**.

- So then I feel we should be asking some questions about **further use**, both for our distant reading project and for our CSS/HTML:
How did our word clouds/websites and our various approaches to them mediate our understanding of the journals, the discipline(s), the class, our graduate careers, and our identities as scholars and aspiring professionals? In what ways do/did/will we get a sense through these activities, through continued writing (website, for now) of how our approaches and our choices--as in velocity--will affect various aspects, including ourselves as users of writing, of future activity?

- I also scanned the class notes for today, and I noticed some questions about how, still, we might define digital rhetoric, or hypertext. Might we consider our class activities thus far as conducive to a hypertextual awareness of writing?

### nrothenay

Passages
- Brooks p. 91 Manovich- “new media culture as an infinite flat surface” and “all or nothing” arrangement
- Brooks p. 140- **at/through/from** + WOW
- Brooks p. 152 information overload
- Brooks p. 188- Wikipedia + credibility
- Porter, **everything**
- Lambke, the reference to Brooks in the blue box

Questions
- How can looking for alternatives to the traditional methods/binaries (like adding from to the at/through discussion) help us think differently about digirhet?
- **Perceptions of information and media and literacy don’t seem to change, despite extensive thinking. How can we change that... or maybe, should we?**
- Open access, Wikipedia, credibility, users modifying and creating content... are these things really all the new? **What happens if they succeed?**
- Information overload and new media, same arguments, different medium. Maybe just a statement, but we’re always shocked by changes, react slowly, and then the next thing. **Can academia ever keep up?**
- My perception is that **delivery is woefully misunderstood and lacking in classrooms, for scholars, and even for a large number of businesses and institutions. Why?** Perception or “truth”? Symptom of seeing “viral” news and failure for most to reliably replicate? Does open access help or exacerbate? Who/how do people act on research? etc etc

### cavsar

> “**Ecology has become a crucial framework in recent years, particularly for scholars who examine media that, paradoxically, grow increasingly interconnected and global, on the one hand, and ever more diverse and intricate, on the other hand**.” Brooke (p.28)

> “The definition of **database as a cultural form, one that shapes our experience as it is used**, is more useful than treatments of databases in the abstract. Furthermore, it reopens the door for us to consider rhetoric in the context of databases.” Brooke (p.101)

> “At another point in his discussion, DeWitt describes this as an “Impulsive Model” of reading, where the **feed-forward nature of Web reading** discourages students from moving “beyond the moment” in their traversal of multiple Web pages.” Brooke (p.154)

> “**In order to retrieve the encoded communication, an individual must be a part of the community with the cultural context for accurate retrieval of that information.**” Haas (p.86)

> “We are specifically interested in **situations where composers anticipate and strategize future third-party remixing of their compositions as part of a larger and complex rhetorical strategy that plays out across physical and digital spaces. We find this type of thinking—the asking of “how might the text be rewritten?” and “why, where, and for whom might this text be rewritten?”—an increasingly important set of questions in a digital age characterized, for instance, by swift, easy, and deep web searching and by copying and pasting practices.**” 	Ridolfo & Devoss (pp.1)

Questions:

1.	In an ecology that is integrated by an increasing amount of voices from diverse backgrounds, how can we make sure that we keep the **authenticity of those voices** instead of trying to uniform them?
2.	We hear a lot the term “culture” referring not only to databases, but to other types of encoded communication. How to guarantee that this culture remains accessible to all, instead of turning into the community of a selected few?
3.	How can this new approach to rhetoric, writing, and the spreading of information help reshape the way we approach history and contemporary problems in everyday society?
4.	Can we talk about a particular “discourse” that would describe digital rhetoric? If yes, who are the ones in charge to define what belongs in that discourse and what are the consequences?
5.	So far, **what does it seem to be the scope of digital rhetoric**? How does that impact its scholarship and contributions?


### emoreno

> Brooke, 28: “We must begin to **rethink notions of rhetorical effectiveness** – whether defined in terms of persuasion, identification, or some other activity – because what is “effective” at one scale or location within an ecology may fail utterly in another context”.  

- If every Ecology is in flux at the ground level, how is (mixed) media playing a role in these fluctuations? **If these ecologies are fluid, where do we begin to understand the rhetorical situation and “select” an audience for our work**? Alternatively, **how is this freeing** if our audience is NOT stagnant or our work is fluid within various spheres of influence?

> Brooke, 91: “[…] **just because there is more than one way to walk through a building, this does not make its arrangement (architecture) irrelevant** […] The links that allegedly demonstrate the irrelevance of rhetoric are rhetorical practices or arrangement, attempts to communicate affinities, connections, and relationships”.

- I think this passage explores the relationship between the rhetorician and audience member, regardless of the level of experience level when entering the space. This returns to **knowing one’s audience as we can funnel them through our portfolios for specific information** (CV/Resume), but still provide avenues for specific information through the hyperlinks that takes them to and from the initial doorway. **How does the architecture change if someone “stumbles” across our sites? Do we provide links to backtrack through what we consider relevant information** (CV/Resume à Bio/Snapshot)?

> Brooke, 174: “[Trimbur] is careful to note that **translation from one medium to another works against a purely transitive notion of delivery**. In this sense, the notion of delivery as medium may serve to keep circulation from becoming synonymous with the transitive form of delivery”.

- Exploration of how different modes of delivery changes the presentation of information. How does this exploration effect how audiences read the material? Translation may refer to the various audiences reading for similar content but must be different for their knowledge-making/meaning purposes.

> Edbauer, 16: “I suggested that we get some bumper stickers that said “Keep Austin Weird,” put our logos on them, and then give them away at our stores. We decided that we should buy 5,000 stickers and see what our customers thought” […] The phrase “Keep Austin Weird” quickly passed into the city’s cultural circulation, taking on the importance of a quasi-civic duty”

- The rhetorical situation embodies an immediate reaction between rhetorician and its specific audience that grows to incorporate far-reaching audience members. The underlined phrase emphasizes the immediate audience, which relies on previously built rapport. As these were customers who already entered the space, they are the immediate audience, but through the ecological function of audience interactions, this slogan reached a wider (more powerful) audience. I think this passage explores how **audience members are like a funnel or a superhighway to other members that shop owners may not have been able to reach previously**.

> Ridolfo and DeVoss: “The term rhetorical velocity, as we deploy it in this webtext, means a **conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party**”.

- The internet allows for a superhighway of exchange, but **how can we be conscious of the various avenues utilized by these third-party audiences**? Who/what are these third-party members and how can we as producers of material funnel them towards our selected audience members? This gives me the same impression as the Edbauer piece when the “Keep Austin Weird” slogan was taken beyond it’s small-business context, like the UT claiming, “Keep Austin Liberal Arts”. Despite our consciousness of rhetorical velocity, **how much control over it do we have in the internet age**?

Other Questions:
- If our portfolios are niche oriented (employment or personal growth) **how can we maintain its flexibility in a ecological system that is constantly changing?** Beyond orientating ourselves with a specific audience, how much of our portfolios should we give access to? Do we link to pages we think are relevant, or do we have all that information on a single page with “jump” links?

- Translation of information is still vague to me. Brooke’s example of Trimbur describes moving text from medical jargon to a New York Times script. All the information is present, but in a different audience. **If it is the same information, does it really change or is it just a difference in framing?** Likewise, if our portfolios are currently being built for the class in preparation for a different audience, is it more of the rearrangement of information that provides clarity, or do we reframe it so much for a new audience that our old audience members are left behind?

### mfitch [link to doc](mfitch.docx)

## Plan that thang

Ya'll all decided to collaborate on a webtext that works with and refines the materials you put together for the distant reading project. Some things we need to do:

* poke around and [look at some webtexts](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/)
* regularize (?) our distant readings
* do an appropriate lit. review or writeup with  
 - Mueller & word-watching
 - Relevant concepts from Brooke, Eyman, etc
 - topics we're wanting to focus on
* plan a design and multimodal argument

## What to do for next week:

Do the thang things.
