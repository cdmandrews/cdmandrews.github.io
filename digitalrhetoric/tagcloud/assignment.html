      <h2>The original assignment: Distant reading of digital rhetoric-related scholarly journal</h2>

      <p>You will be assigned a scholarly journal related to digital rhetoric. Become a "word watcher" (Mueller, p. 73) and conduct a distant reading of the last five published issues. Create a series of word clouds to share and discuss with your classmates, and publish them as a webtext on your profile/portfolio site.</p>
      <h3>Project Details</h3>
      <p>The list of journals we'll work from:</p>

        <li>Computers & Composition
        <li>other things I add to this list</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Working with chapter 3 ("Turn Spotting") from Derek Mueller’s<a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/books/writing/network/"> Network Sense</a> and other assigned texts, conduct a distant reading of the last five published issues of your assigned/selected journal. You will create a series of word clouds to share and discuss with your classmates, and will publish them as a webtext on your profile/portfolio site.</p>
      <h3>Deliverable: series of word clouds showing your findings.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Use TagCloud, Voyant, or another appropriate tool to create word cloud visualizations of articles from five issues (we’ll collaborate to discuss methodological problems such as how many, whether to include bibliographies, web scraping, etc.,.). You will create five separate visualizations (on TagCloud, just take a screenshot or use the HTML embed instructions; on Voyant, you can export an HTML snippet or a PNG file--if you choose to use HTML snippets, get a PNG for backup).
          <li>Create a simple HTML page to publish your five visualizations on. Identify each figure with a caption and descriptive text, and use headings on the page as appropriate. (We’ll add a stylesheet later.)
          <li>At the top of the page (before the word clouds), summarize and comment on your findings. Consider some of the following questions:
        <ul>
          <li>What units of meaning does this method of reading help you apprehend?
          <li>What themes, patterns, or trends do you notice in and across your word clouds?
          <li>What questions, connections, patterns, or insights do they provoke?
          <li>How has this reading (and publishing) activity helped you make sense of “digital rhetoric” (whatever that is)?</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ol>
      <p>We will use the results of your distant readings to inform “special topic” days towards the end of the semester, reviewing current work (even “turns”?) in digital rhetoric, composition, and technical communication on topics the class agrees upon. You will also use these as entry points for your annotated bibliographies.</p>
      <p>This is just proof of concept: The individual (but standardized) stylesheets for tagcloud clouds have been pulled out with a few changs (esp from id to class). We can from there adjust size, color, etcetera, and still have text versions of the visualizations. <a href="tagcloud-index.html">Back to home</a></p>
