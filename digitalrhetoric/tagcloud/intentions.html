<strong>Word clouds as a practice of novitiate word-watching (intro to digital rhetoric course situated in a more-or-less traditional MA; threshold concepts or students locating themselves in relation to the field)</strong>

The visualizations that result from distant reading methodologies have been cited for their introductory capacity, their offering up of epistemologically generative visions of networks, or what Colin Brooke (2009) might call a “proairetic” perspective on the discipline that is “future-oriented, participatory, and heuristic” (Mueller, 2017, p. 4). Brooke described his small-scale tag cloud database of CCC article keywords as a provocative visual interface for those texts--a snapshot that offers a perspective on “the investment attached to particular terms” (2009, p. 110). Though not a stand-in for close (or other) kinds of reading of the scholarship, Brooke posited that the “synoptic view” the word cloud’s abbreviated and visually-oriented interface provides could be useful to newcomers, though he didn’t push that insight much beyond the suggestion.

In “Views from a Distance: A Nephological Model of the CCCC’s Chair’s Addresses, 1977-2011,” Derek Mueller (2012) described the possible value of word clouds in particular:
</p>
<p>

    <em>As the scholarly record grows there is an escalating value in realizing connections. This is exceedingly important for newcomers to the field who must make inroads however they can, by conversation and conventional reading and writing, of course, but also by pattern-finding, by nomadically exploring conceptual interplay across abstracts and abstractive variations, and by finding and tracing linkages among materials and ideas, new and old. (page 1)</em>
</p>
<p>
Distant readings thus possibly alleviate the trouble invoked by both kinds of “new”—1) the tension scholars back to antiquity have felt about keeping up with ever-growing bodies of recent developments and work in a field as well as 2) the strain graduate students have felt as they enter their specializations and figure out new scenes, new disciplines, and new subdisciplines. This second trouble—the newcomer’s widening gaze—is the core focus of this webtext, which describes the experiences of a group of Master’s degree-level students as they used word clouds to figure out “digital rhetoric”—noting that for many of these students, in particular students in their first semester of graduate study, even the notion of divisions of subfields of English beyond literary and writing courses is new ground. Mueller’s (2012) invitation to occasionally turn our gazes “toward clouds” and seek patterns in the nomadic, conceptual, and distant readings of word clouds and other distant reading visualizations…

</p>
<p>
In <em>Network Sense</em> (2017) Mueller posited that distant readings offer “incomplete but nevertheless vital glimpses” into disciplines (or other domains its gaze is levelled at). By generating their own field threshold concepts through distant and thin methods, graduate students can embrace the introductory capacities of the process and also begin to think about research issues such as sampling and methodology. The presentations or results of distant readings also offer an opportunity to understand digital rhetoric as a set of practices and theoretical concerns: understanding how to make and read word clouds might then serve three concerns for digital rhetoric: the disciplinary, the productive, and the analytical.

(summarize what our word clouds were)
</p>
<p>
One way these network sensed accounts work is by corroboration--placing distant readings against other accounts of a discipline in situations where information overload is inherent. (in our own case, against each others’ accounts as well as our readings of Douglas Eyman’s <em>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice</em>)  In that sense, our word clouds are interfaces that open up a field that has been described as broad and undefinable (Hodgson & Barnett, 2016).

<li>Eyman: digital rhetoric as “application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances” (Eyman 2015, 44); the both/and of mapping classical theories and methods onto digital media and modes with extending rhetorical theory to account for new ways of making meaning. “The digital allows us to both re-invigorate and re-imagine rhetoric as well as providing an impetus to innovate and invent as well.” (Eyman 2016)
