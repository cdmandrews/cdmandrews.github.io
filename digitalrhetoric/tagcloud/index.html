<h2>How to read this text</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this webtext was some word clouds made in a graduate seminar in the Department of English at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi in Fall 2019. In this webtext, we (nine Master of Arts degree-seeking students and their scatterbrained professor) share our exploration of the word cloud as a digital rhetoric artifact.</p>
<p>This wordcloud offers readers the chance to enter the webtext wheresoever they wish, allowing the arugment, core themes, and other concerns of the webtext to emerge. There is no singular linear pathway through the webtext, though it does have definite <a href="introduction.html">openings-up</a> and <a href="conclusions.html">closings-off</a>. In a manner similar to <a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/16.3/topoi/johnson-eilola/index.html">Johnson-Eilola (2011)</a>the webtext does offer ways through: assocational (but not randomized) links have been placed on each page to facilitate experiences of the webtext. Mostly, readers are encouraged to click around, get lost, and see what happens.</p>
