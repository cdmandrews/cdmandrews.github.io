      <h2>What is the question?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>What was the assignment supposed to do, and what theory or scholarship informs it?</li>
        <li>Are word clouds a useful form of novitiate word-watching? Useful for what or whom? Or, what does it take for them to <em>be</em> useful? Or is the concept "useful" even where we're supposed to beging?</li>
        <li>What are the limitations of word clouds (or at least this approach to them)? What can they not do, or what do they do badly?</li>
      </ol>
