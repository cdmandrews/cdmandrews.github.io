    <h2>Course projects</h2>
		<p>I will always describe changes to major projects during our synchronous class meetings, will always put them in writing, and will strive to only make mutually advantageous changes--ones that will enhance rather than detract from your learning.</p>
		<p>Regardless of medium, all projects should include a medium-appropriate method of citation. We'll talk about what that means extensively in class; you'll be most familiar with a properly-formatted bibliography according to current MLA or APA guidelines. Please consult the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers (7th ed) or the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (6th ed, 2nd printing) accordingly.</p>
	</section>
		<section>
		<h3>Multi-page profile website (HTML & CSS)</h3>
		<p>You will create a professional-oriented profile or portfolio site for yourself. This site will also be where you’ll publish the other projects you’ll create for the course.</p>

		      <h4>Project Details</h4>

							<p>For the first iteration of the project, you will create at least three well-formed, valid semantic HTML pages that will form the foundation of your professional web presence. One of the pages must be your professional resume.</p>
							<p>Your second iteration builds on your HTML pages, which you will further revise and fully style with CSS to provide a basic typographic treatment and responsive design that makes use of media queries and relative units. You will publish your pages to a server behind a domain name under your control.</p>
							<p>We'll spend LOTS of time with this project in class for the first half of the course.</p>

		<h3>Distant reading of digital rhetoric-related scholarly journal</h3>
		<p>You will be assigned a scholarly journal related to digital rhetoric. Become a "word watcher" (Mueller, p. 73) and conduct a distant reading of the last five published issues. Create a series of word clouds to share and discuss with your classmates, and publish them as a webtext on your profile/portfolio site.</p>
		<h4>Project Details</h4>
		  		<p>The list of journals we'll work from:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/"><em>Kairos</em></a></li>
								<li><a href="http://enculturation.net/"><em>Enculturation</em></a></li>
								<li><a href="http://www.xchanges.org/"><em>XChanges</em></a></li>
								<li><a href="https://hybridpedagogy.org/"><em>Hybrid Pedagogy</em></a></li>
								<li><a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/"><em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em></a></li>
								<li><a href="https://www.presenttensejournal.org/"><em>Present Tense</em></a></li>
								<li><a href="http://journalofmultimodalrhetorics.com/"><em>Journal of Multimodal Rhetorics</em></a></li>
								<li><a href="http://peitho.cwshrc.org/"><em>Peitho</em></a></li>
								<li><a href="https://tcjournal.org/"><em>Technoculture</em></a></li>
								<li>Computers & Composition</li>
								<li><em>other things I add to this list</em></li>
							</ul>
							<p>Working with chapter 3 ("Turn Spotting") from Derek Mueller’s <a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/books/writing/network/"><cite>Network Sense</cite></a> and other assigned texts, conduct a distant reading of the last five published issues of your assigned/selected journal. You will create a series of word clouds to share and discuss with your classmates, and will publish them as a webtext on your profile/portfolio site.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Skim/Read<a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/16.2/topoi/mueller/">http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/16.2/topoi/mueller/</a> (esp section 2, “Views from a Distance”)</li>
								<li>See also <a href="http://technorhetoric.net/22.2/topoi/palmeri-mccorkle/">http://technorhetoric.net/22.2/topoi/palmeri-mccorkle/</a> for another version of distant reading)</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Deliverable: series of word clouds showing your findings.</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Use TagCloud, Voyant, or another appropriate tool to create word cloud visualizations of articles from five issues (we’ll collaborate to discuss methodological problems such as how many, whether to include bibliographies, web scraping, etc.,.). You will create five separate visualizations (on TagCloud, just take a screenshot or use the HTML embed instructions; on Voyant, you can export an HTML snippet or a PNG file--if you choose to use HTML snippets, get a PNG for backup).</li>
								<li>Create a simple HTML page to publish your five visualizations on. Identify each figure with a caption and descriptive text, and use headings on the page as appropriate. (We’ll add a stylesheet later.)</li>
								<li>At the top of the page (before the word clouds), summarize and comment on your findings. Consider some of the following questions:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>What units of meaning does this method of reading help you apprehend?</li>
									<li>What themes, patterns, or trends do you notice in and across your word clouds?</li>
									<li>What questions, connections, patterns, or insights do they provoke?</li>
									<li>How has this reading (and publishing) activity helped you make sense of “digital rhetoric” (whatever that is)?</li>
								</ul>
							</ol>
							<p>We will use the results of your distant readings to inform “special topic” days towards the end of the semester, reviewing current work (even “turns”?) in digital rhetoric, composition, and technical communication on topics the class agrees upon. You will also use these as entry points for your annotated bibliographies.</p>

		<h3>Rhetorical analysis of digital media</h3>
			<p>Choose a piece of digital media to explore and prepare a rhetorical analysis of it based on your reading of <em>Lingua Fracta</em> and other course texts. Your rhetorical analysis will be delivered as a webtext published on your profile/portfolio site.</p>
			<h4>Project Details</h4>
							<p>Begin by selecting a piece of digital media to analyze; I encourage you to choose a piece of media that links in some way to other projects or that links to your professional interests.</p>
							<p>You might, for example, want to do a web site analysis, perhaps looking at the portfolio of a working professional, the web site of a company or organization you’re interested in, a passionate affinity space of some kind, a social media space, hashtag or or comment thread, or the web space of a local nonprofit organization.</p>
							<p>Work from (and rework) concepts suggested in our readings and use them as a lens for your analysis. Most important here will be some element or combination of elements from <em>Lingua Fracta</em>, but you might also apply other frameworks we’ll examine such as Porter’s delivery commonplaces or Sheridan, Ridolfo, & Michel’s kairotic web.</p>
			</section>

		<section>
		<h3>Annotated bibliography</h3>
			<p>Working from your distant reading, you will take a deep dive on a concept, question, or idea that’s interested you and prepare an annotated bibliography of 10 sources on the subject. Your annotated bibliography will be delivered as a webtext published on your profile/portfolio site.</p>
			<h4>Project Details</h4>
							<p>As well as practicing our multimodal authoring skills, this is an opportunity to focus in one of our core course activities: “survey scholarship in digital rhetoric and explore the relevance of that work for composition teaching and professions in writing and technical communication”</p>
							<p>The <cite>Purdue OWL</cite> has a thorough introduction to <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/common_writing_assignments/annotated_bibliographies/index.html">annotated bibliographies</a> that you’ll find useful if you’ve never worked on the genre before. For this project, your annotations should both summarize the essential relevant arguments or findings of each piece of scholarship as well as draw connections between the work you have created. You’ll need to compose an introduction that frames your collection adequately for a reader: what's the collection about, why do these stick together, and ultimately what is the relevance of the work you’ve assembled?</p>
							<p>You should include appropriate multimedia elements to help draw the collection together and make vivid your arguments. Annotations should be approximately 250 words in length (?) not counting the bibliographic citation. Include links to texts that are available on the web.</p>
							<p>Examples of annotated bibliographies:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Cox, M. B., & Faris, M. J. (2015). An annotated bibliography of LGBTQ rhetorics. <cite>Present Tense: A Journal Of Rhetoric In Society</cite>, 4(2). Retrieved from: <a href="http://www.presenttensejournal.org/volume-4/an-annotated-bibliography-of-lgbtq-rhetorics/">http://www.presenttensejournal.org/volume-4/an-annotated-bibliography-of-lgbtq-rhetorics/</a></li>
