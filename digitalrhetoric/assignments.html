    <h2>Course Projects</h2>
    <p>Full descriptions of course projects and assignments</p>

		<h3>Multi-page profile website (HTML & CSS)</h3>
			<p>You will create a professional-oriented profile or portfolio site for yourself. This site will also be where you’ll publish the other projects you’ll create for the course.</p>

			<p>For the first iteration of the project, you will create at least three well-formed, valid semantic HTML pages that will form the foundation of your professional web presence. One of the pages must be your professional resume.</p>

			<p>Your second iteration builds on your HTML pages, which you will further revise and fully style with CSS to provide a basic typographic treatment and responsive design that makes use of media queries and relative units. You will publish your pages to a server behind a domain name under your control.</p>

		<h3>Distant reading of digital rhetoric-related scholarly journal</h3>
			<p>You will be assigned one of the following scholarly journals: <em>Kairos</em>, <em>Enculturation</em>, <em>Hybrid Pedagogy</em>, <em>Computers & Composition Online</em>, or one of a few others (I will provide a full list). Working with excerpts from Mueller’s <em>Networked Sense</em>, conduct a distant reading of the last five published issues. You will create a series of word clouds to share and discuss with your classmates, and will publish them as a webtext on your profile/portfolio site.</p>

			<p>We will use the results of your distant readings to inform “special topic” days towards the end of the semester, reviewing current work in digital rhetoric, composition, and technical communication on topics the class agrees upon. You will also use these as entry points for your annotated bibliographies.</p>

		<h3>Rhetorical analysis of digital media</h3>
			<p>Choose a piece of digital media to explore and prepare a rhetorical analysis of it based on your reading of <em>Lingua Fracta</em> and other course texts. Your rhetorical analysis will be delivered as a webtext published on your profile/portfolio site.</p>

		<h3>Annotated bibliography</h3>
			<p>Working from your distant reading, you will take a deep dive on a concept, question, or idea that’s interested you and prepare an annotated bibliography of 8-10 sources on the subject. Your annotated bibliography will be delivered as a webtext published on your profile/portfolio site.</p>

			<p>Regardless of medium, all projects using research and references are required to include a correctly-formatted bibliography according to current MLA or APA guidelines. Please consult the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers (7th ed) or the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (6th ed, 2nd printing) accordingly.</p>
