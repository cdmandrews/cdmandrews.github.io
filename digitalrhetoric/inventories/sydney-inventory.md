# Skills inventory: 
1. What do you know how to do? How comfortable are you with the technologies? 
> It's been a long time since I've had to mess with HTML (throwback to that one web design course in high school). Currently, I use third-party website hosting sites like Weebly or Wix that allow users to just place things in boxes and click "Submit." With that said, I feel comfortable trying out different technologies, which is quite a broad term. If I can google or search on the Youtubes and have a healthy dose of motivation, it's fair game.  
2. How comfortable are you with *playing* with the technologies? (sidenote: what’s the difference between *skill* and *play*?)
> I'm open to learning technologies. While I regularly put things in boxes (i.e. Weebly or Animoto), I'd like to try my hand at building outside of premade boxes. Plus, if it doesn't work I can just try again with a different method. 
##### P.S. *Skill* implies that you know how to do the thing. *Play* can be a spectrum and/or negates credibility (connotated with fun and games).
