# praxis idea:

What sort of thing can I **make with** Digital Rhetoric students that works with and out of their distant readings? What do they do, and what is the (here's the proposition) publication?

I suppose it's kind of testing the assertion (especially by Mueller), though I like fiddling and playing (engaging in a rhetorical ecology that relates proairesis, pattern, persistence, and performance in a methodological *fucking around*) that word clouds are a good form of novice-centric word-watching, useful for graduate students entering the field to get a kind of loose "network sense" that could be followed up with other kinds of reading/delivery activities.

The word "testing" here doesn't mean we'd be truly testing that assertion as a form of experimental research (oh the Type I and II errors abound!), but certainly putting that assertion to an enactive and performative test.

Is such a webtext (of course it would a webtext coming out of this class) a reflection on a "method" and methodological reenactment? On rhetorical ecologies of digital rhetoric scholarship? Of methodological academic professionalization? What is it we're understanding here?

Digital rhetoric's digital rhetoric (the problem of introducing a field to students who didn't even know the field's a field or if they did didn't have much sense of what it meant (rhetoric, much less digital rhetoric, being alien space and time.).). Rhetorical ecology stuff--lots of Brooke and Mueller.

I see a text that puts together (clean but not sterile) versions (or mutiple iterations) of the class' word clouds, inviting reflection and generative (proairetic) perspectives on reading-forward and pattern-sensing. Thus reading digital rhetoric via digital rhetoric (a la Brooke and Eyman and others). Create a hypertextual scholarly reflection that describes and assesses what we see, what we read, how we follow up on it, and how we did it. Include some instructor reflectheorizing. Galleries (?) of word clouds and superclouds at various levels of scalability. And inviting the sorts of questioning that we can do with that kind of information.

Do we include other journals? Where do we stop? How do we ensure "method" to our madness? Why should we/not ensure method? I think this is what I want to work on with my students for the next coupla weeks. We could drop the rhetorical analysis assignment for the most part and just work on this and maybe only the parts of the nannotated bibliography that are relevant to this project (i.e. comparing readings at scale: dips into particular corpuses to high-level cloud scans) for the rest of the semester and I'd be happy. Would they? Of course working through a rhetorical multimodal production would be interesting and an engaging and worthwile activity on its own right.

Have to map out the work over seven weeks. Need lit review (of a sort), collection, noticing, archiving, etc. Plan to divide and conquer.

Need standard text files to code/analyze, probably a collaborative Sotero doc for bibliographic noticing, etc.
