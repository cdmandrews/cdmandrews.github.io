## Discussion of ze readings

### Hayles (2004)
- what does it mean to "attend to the materiality of the medium"? (Hayles 2004) (Or, to crib from WCW, "No ideas but in things." Is that like "imaginary gardens with real toads in them," per Marianne Moore? Perhaps a quiz question too far...) What's Cartesian dualism got to do with things?

> ayles: "materiality should be understood as existing in complex dynamic interplay with
content, coming into focus or fading into the background, depending on what performances the work
enacts." (p. 71).

Closely related: Lanham, oscillatio, and AT/THROUGH.

Some key concepts/phrases from Hayles:
  - hypertext as space, as mutable/transformable, as bilingual, as multidimensional, as fragmented/recombined, as analogue/digital, as dynamic image
  - distributed cognition
  - cyborg reading practices

### Edbauer (2005)

What's so great about the ecological model for rhetoric? (as opposed to elemental/situation frameworks?)

> we might still ask whether notions of rhetorical situation adequately account for the "constitutive circulation" of rhetoric in the social field. Do theories of rhetorical situation allow us to theorize how "concatenation of texts through time" help to create publics? ... (no) The problem with many takes on rhetorical situation is their tendency to conceptualize rhetoric within a scene of already-formed, already-discrete individuals [... and] treat 'audience' as a rather unproblematic and obvious site. (p. 7)

"TH elements of rhetorical situation simply bleed." (p. 9)

"To say that we are connected is another way of saying that we are never outside the networked interconnection of forces, energies, rhetorics, moods, and experiences."

from sites to processes, situs to distribution.

"an ecological or affective rhetorical model is one that reads rhetoric both as a process of distributed emergence and as an ongoing circulation process." (p. 13)

distributed rhetorical ecologies (how do we account for the spread--the amalgamations and transformations--of a rhetoric in its wider ecology)

> Indeed, like maps, clouds are more than neutral descriptions; they are constructs with properties that deliberately bring forward selected qualities of texts while downplaying others. (p. 2

> Subject to distant reading methods the addresses disappear and are replaced by substitutive, or tropical abstractions: a series of word clouds, in this case. Paradoxically, the addresses resurface in a severely abridged light as they are simultaneously remade, staged again, and resent into circulation (agitated, delivered).

> The visibility of such patterns yields related openings for inquiry and speculation: Can we imagine a primarily light-hued cloud in years to come? Or an address to the field absent such constants as students, writing, composition, college, university, or literacy? I raise these questions cautiously aware that they may appear critical of convention; however, I am foremost interested in pointing out that heuristic openings created by the clouds are as important as the report they offer on the culture of CCCC. That is, I maintain that the model's conceptual counterpart, network sense, functions both as a perspective on the culture of the organization and a catalyst for action concerning the shape of the field to come. (p. 2)

> As a type of distant reading, word clouds turn to data-mining processes to draw the most frequently used terms from full-text versions of the addresses. A radical reduction occurs in this meronymous amalgamation. Selected parts stand out from the thick, ecologically entangled whole. Yet this reduction is only temporary: The clouds elicit wonder or memory encounters without urging permanent annihilation of the full text. These, like all word clouds, yield a heuristic if in looking at them we find provocations to tease and shape further inquiry. (p. 5)
