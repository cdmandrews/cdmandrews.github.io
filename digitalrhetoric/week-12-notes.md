# "Handout" for Week 12

[ENGL 5369, Fall 2019](calendar.html)

[Slides if you want such things](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRufA94YIvpbFkJ2K591QOVPqCeLM5nAcGgkbJ0uiCuOgYeWh5OUR1FXmLTWgReyHFb8yPoLY4kWyb5/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

[Everyone's sites so far](fambly)

## To do for today:

* regularize (?) or make methodical our distant readings
* do an appropriate lit. review or writeup with  
  - Mueller & word-watching
  - Relevant concepts from Brooke, Eyman, etc
  - topics we're wanting to focus on
  - other research and abstracting of key texts for distant reading, grad student professionalization, digital rhetoric, other topics?
* plan a design and multimodal argument
  - new word clouds: Suggested to use TagCloud, which will create accessible and uniform text versions (rather than images of text versions) of word clouds. If concerned with size, be sure to use "upload files" rather than copy/paste.

As we begin to really put together "meanings" or readings of these distant readings, Brooke's ecology of perspective (the "from" additive to Lanham's "at/through" oscillation) is useful. That is, **where do you come to these readings from**? As graduate students (the inherent **from* of the assignment** what are the different perspectives you're reading these from. I'd invite reflecting on your relationship to reading, close reading, English as a discipline, English as a set of (increasingly varied and subdivided) subfields, your 'position' in the MA program, or any of the other varied "froms" we might consider. (Are you at the beginning, in the middle, at the end? Are you coming to these new or with preconceptions? Have you had to do connective close readings of the discipline yet in the form of a comprehensive exam or a thesis?)

Some key articles in *Enculturation* and *Kairos* re distant reading and digital rhetoric:
- [Enculturation 23](http://enculturation.net/23) articles to review include:
  - ways of knowing and doing in dr?
  - what's digital about dr?
  - dr as an evolving field?
  - methods for research in dr?
- Kairos
  - Mueller, [nephological model](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/16.2/topoi/mueller/)
  - Palmeri & McCorkle, [distant EJ](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/22.2/topoi/palmeri-mccorkle/methodology.html)

## To do for next time:

1. **Review [Planning Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3eqoKboW5nIjoE4JwylVwixWGf2yGDamUGwuYlfUBA/edit?usp=sharing) we compiled together in class**
2. Core writing tasks (think of these as nodes) to complete before next planning meeting (refer to Planning Notes doc as needed; pull in material from our course readings or other readings as needed or to help develop ideas. Please remember to quote relevant scholarship as framework or development of your topics.) *Use the existing email thread to support, share, or ask questions over the coming week!* 
  - **Write a few rich paragraphs about your "from"**: What is the perspective/identities you're coming from as you do/read/use word clouds? (i.e. as you do/read this distant reading, are you coming at them as a new MA student, an exiting MA student, as new to English studies, as new to the notion of multiple subfields, as heading for academic path, as heading for non-academic path, etc.)
  - **Write one or more rich paragraphs defining your "method" for creating your word clouds** Write up your own short methods section. Look at others' examples for inspiration.
  - **Write more extensively about "What am I interested in?" with these word clouds.** (Note: You are not married to these ideas; they are just generative starting places for writing. These are trying to get at some of Sydney's *"So What?"* There are other pieces we didn't consider and are possible here. Return to your notes prepared for Week 12 for ideas and scholarship to integrate.)
  - **Consider how you individually might integrate some or all of your word clouds** (new and/or original) as part of your portion of the publication. Also consider how/what scale of word clouds would be illustrative/persuasive for the collaborative argument.

### The plan for the next few weeks:
  - **Week 13**: Bring written material (see "to-do" list above) for analysis/discussion and tracing of key themes/nodes. Workshopping. Writing. Check out the [Kairos Style Guide](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/styleguide.html). Refine ideas for [site structure](https://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/3-site-structure.html) and define next steps to make/include/remake word clouds.
  - **Week 14**: Rest for the break. Work on "new" word clouds and revise a little bit. Take pictures of your doggos, kittehs, sneks, or stuffies.
  - **Week 15**: Work on interface/design/site structure for webtext. Workshopping. Writing. Trying not to freak out in unhealthy ways.
  - **Week 16**: Revise, revise, revise. Probably more design work and troubleshooting. See if we can have a rough draft of the webtext done, to be submitted in the coming weeks. Define individual production roles and relationships as we head into the murk of "when the semester's over and we're moving on to other things."
