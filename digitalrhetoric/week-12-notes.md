# "Handout" for Week 12

[ENGL 5369, Fall 2019](calendar.html)

[Slides if you want such things](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRufA94YIvpbFkJ2K591QOVPqCeLM5nAcGgkbJ0uiCuOgYeWh5OUR1FXmLTWgReyHFb8yPoLY4kWyb5/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

[Everyone's sites so far](fambly)

## To do for today:

* regularize (?) or make methodical our distant readings
* do an appropriate lit. review or writeup with  
  - Mueller & word-watching
  - Relevant concepts from Brooke, Eyman, etc
  - topics we're wanting to focus on
  - other research and abstracting of key texts for distant reading, grad student professionalization, digital rhetoric, other topics?
* plan a design and multimodal argument
  - new word clouds: Suggested to use TagCloud, which will create accessible and uniform text versions (rather than images of text versions) of word clouds. If concerned with size, be sure to use "upload files" rather than copy/paste.

As we begin to really put together "meanings" or readings of these distant readings, Brooke's ecology of perspective (the "from" additive to Lanham's "at/through" oscillation) is useful. That is, **where do you come to these readings from**? As graduate students (the inherent **from* of the assignment** what are the different perspectives you're reading these from. I'd invite reflecting on your relationship to reading, close reading, English as a discipline, English as a set of (increasingly varied and subdivided) subfields, your 'position' in the MA program, or any of the other varied "froms" we might consider. (Are you at the beginning, in the middle, at the end? Are you coming to these new or with preconceptions? Have you had to do connective close readings of the discipline yet in the form of a comprehensive exam or a thesis?)
