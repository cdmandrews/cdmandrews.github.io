### Comfort with technology and playing with tech
> I probably focus on **play** over *actual skill*; there are so many things to learn! I've dabbled in a little bit of everything. I believe that I have *almost*-advanced skills in quite a few areas, but those areas are pretty **scattered** and **inconsistent**. I enjoy learning and playing with new software and skills, but ***I'm not really sure where I should focus my energy***.
