    <p>As a <strong>technorhetorician</strong>, I <em>teach young professionals</em> how to write, engage, advocate, and continually professionalize by using rhetoric in a writing-rich and <b>media-slick</b> world. I <i>research and write</i> about how technical and professional communicators use digital and social writing to learn, connect, create, and share. <br>I <q>serve the discipline</q> and other institutions with writing and multimodal editing expertise in <cite>HTML</cite> and other technologies. I advocate for <a id="firstsection" href="index.html" target="_blank">institutions, <em>groups</em>, and individuals to critically engage</a> with and through technology, trying to live out Andrew Feenberg's call to question technology by focusing on human ends rather than technical ease.</p>
