[Everyone's sites so far](fambly)

## To do for today:

You should have:   
  - **Worked out your reflection/discussion**
  - **Worked out your new word clouds and answers to OG questions:**
  - **Other tasks if assigned:**

Tonight we're working on the thing: Updated [pouf of concept](tagcloud/index.html)

* work on design (Sydney & Emille should have some ideas for us!)
  - check out vertical/horizontal layouts and other issues on the example.
* work on lit. review, expanding, or writing up existing parts (we worked on this some over the break; not 100% yet)
  - topics we're wanting to focus on
  - other research and abstracting of key texts for distant reading, digital rhetoric, other topics?
  - what are our conclusions? (are there conclusions?)
* shovel reflection/discussion into HTML templates
  - need a filename convention
* shovel NEW word clouds into HTML templates
  - need a filename convention


## To do for next time:
 - Work on the work
 - Revise, revise, revise. Probably more design work and troubleshooting. See if we can have a rough draft of the webtext done, to be submitted in the coming weeks. Define individual production roles and relationships as we head into the murk of "when the semester's over and we're moving on to other things."
