<h2>Praxis: Distant reading</h2>
    <blockquote>
    As a type of distant reading, word clouds turn to data-mining processes to draw the most frequently used terms from full-text versions of the addresses. A radical reduction occurs in this meronymous amalgamation. Selected parts stand out from the thick, ecologically entangled whole. Yet this reduction is only temporary: The clouds elicit wonder or memory encounters without urging permanent annihilation of the full text. These, like all word clouds, yield a heuristic if in looking at them we find provocations to tease and shape further inquiry. (Mueller, Views p. 5)
    </blockquote>
  <p>First, we should check out and discuss your wordclouds.</p>

  </ul>

<p>Let's take some time and do some "noticing" in everyone's clouds.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What do you see/notice?</li>
    <li>What questions emerge?</li>
    <li>What are the keyest key terms circulating across all of these?</li>
    <li>What is our distant reading's account of these texts?</li>
    <li>What sort of knowledge do we need to make use of these clouds?</li>
    <li>What kind of systematic data coding (and preparation) would we need to do to make better use of our initial distant reading?</li>
    <li>What happens (does/can anything happen) when we place these alongside Eyman's discussion of the "primary activities in the field of digital rhetoric"?
    <ul class="important">
      <li>the use of rhetorical strategies in production and analysis of digital texts</li>
      <li>identifying characteristics, affordances, and constraints of new media</li>
      <li>formation of digital identities</li>
      <li>potential for building social communities (first four from Zappen, 2005, p. 319)</li>
      <li>inquiry and development of rhetorics of technology</li>
      <li>the use of rhetorical methods for uncovering and interrogating ideologies and cultural formation in digital work</li>
      <li>an examination of the rhetorical function of networks</li>
      <li>theorization of agency when interlocutors are as likely to be software agents (or “spimes”) as they are human actors (full list from Eyman, 2015, ch 1.)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Praxis: CSS in the HTML and drink em bot' up.</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Create an empty text file in your main HTML directory named <code>style.css</code> (you can name it anything you like).</li>
    <li>To link the CSS file to your HTML files, add the following line of markup in the <code>head</code> element of each of your HTML files: <br><code>&lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;</code></li>
    <li>Don't forget to remove the old stylesheet link from your index.html if it's still there.</li>
  </ol>
<h3>How CSS works</h3>
  <p>As you read in Stolley, <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a plain text file format used for formatting content marked up in HTML.</p>
  <p>Your browser already uses a default stylesheet to define how it displays  HTML markup. For example, in Firefox on my laptop, basic HTML pages are displayed in Times New Roman, while in Firefox on my Samsung Note, pages display in my device's default sans serif typeface. Spacing, margins, and text sizes are all set in this stylesheet as well.</p>
  <figure><img src="../teaching/fa18-3379/media/two-styles.png">
    <figcaption>Comparison of the same HTML page with default styles on different devices.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>CSS gives your browser rules that affect how linked HTML documents should be displayed. CSS rules are formed from:
  </p><ul>
    <li><strong>properties</strong>, which have <strong>values</strong> to update how HTML content is displayed</li>
    <li><strong>selectors</strong>, which select which elements to apply those properties to. Selectors allow you to target all elements of a certain type.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p><p>A CSS rule looks like this:</p>
  <figure><img src="../teaching/fa18-3379/media/rule1.png">
    <figcaption>A CSS rule with a single selector and a single declaration. The selector is <code>p</code>, the property is <code>color</code>, and the value is <code>blue</code>.</figcaption>
  </figure><p></p>
<p>In the example above, the rule begins with the p selector; it will apply property values (called a <strong>declaration</strong>) to all paragraph elements on the HTML page. In this case, the declaration sets the paragraph text color to blue. The property and value of a CSS declaration are separated by a colon. A declaration is separated from the next declaration with a semicolon. Notice that some declarations can include multiple values. For example:</p>
  <figure><img src="../teaching/fa18-3379/media/rule2.png">
      <figcaption>A CSS rule with a single selector and multiple declarations.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<h4>A comment on comments</h4>
  <p>CSS comments use the format <code>/* This is a comment in CSS */</code> Use CSS comments to keep track of those tricky decisions, calculations, and other notes (especially as you're learning) that will help you understand what you were trying to do and why.</p>
  <p>CSS files don't have a bunch of rules for structure; they're simply lists of rules, applied in order from beginning to end. Many developers will use comments to create sections and organize their stylesheets for themselves and other users. See <a href="https://cdmandrews.github.io/css/style.css">my stylesheet</a> for examples.</p>

    <li>Haas, Wampum hypertext</li>
    <li>Brooke 4 (Pattern[arrangement])
      <ol>
        <li>"Just because there is more than one way to walk through a building, this does not make its arrangement (architecture) irrelevant" (p. 91)</li>
        <li>hmm... seems like a good chapter to look at when we're talking about word cloud distant reading...</li>
      </ol></li>
    <li>Brooke 5 (Perspective[style])
      <ol>
        <li>"Proper" is what some group of people has agreed upon, and no more. The "contingent, consensual qualities of that agreement are eventually forgotten, leaving a normed or proper name for which metaphors are described as deviations" (p. 124). </li>
        <li>hmm... seems like another good chapter to look at when we're talking about word cloud distant reading...</li>

      </ol></li>
    <li>Brooke 6 (Persistence[memory])
      <ol>
        <li>Persistence as a memory practice is the ability to build and maintain patterns although those patterns may be tentative and ultimately fade into the background.” (Brooke, p. 157)</li>
        <li>hmm... seems like <span class="important">yet another</span> good chapter to look at when we're talking about word cloud distant reading...</li>
