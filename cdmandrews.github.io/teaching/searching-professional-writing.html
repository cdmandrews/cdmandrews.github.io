<h2>Searching for professional and technical writing online</h2>
  <p>How do I find examples of professional writing genres? </p>
  <p>(Hey, wait. <a href="https://openenglishatslcc.pressbooks.com/chapter/genre-in-the-wild-understanding-genre-within-rhetorical-ecosystems/">What's a genre</a> again?)</p>

  <p>Google is not the answer to all things, because Google doesn't search everything available on the internet. Googling "amicus brief" or "incident report" or "things police chiefs write" will take me to vague or generic information and the same redacted templates and illegible samples that many ad-infested and overly-simplistic websites use. </p>

  <p>You need specific information. So you need more advanced search strategies. I might start with a general internet search, but I know that because Google doesn't index every page of every site on the internet, and that not every PDF or HTML document on every website will show up on a web search. </p>
  <p><strong>BUT!</strong> Because I'm a student of professional and technical communication, I know that <strong>institutions</strong> generate, sponsor, and have authorship of tons of professional and technical writing, I can do some detective work and search <strong>institutions' web content</strong>.</p>
  <p>For example, I might start my Google search looking for a list of major law firms in Texas, or a specific one if I know of it. I might search for a list of legal bloggers, or search for professional organizations (is there an association for police chiefs? what about unions?). </p>

  <p>But I don't stay on Google long. I really want to look at federal, state, and municipal websites (most often ending with a .gov). State courts have a website, counties have websites, cities have websites, as do professional organizations.</p>
  <p>When I'm scanning organizations' web pages, I look in navigation menus and page footers for key terms like <em>publications</em>, <em>transparency</em>, or <em>reports</em> and follow those links. I use website-specific searches rather than full internet searches. I vary between specific names for genres (<em>amicus briefs</em>) and general ones (<em>briefs, proposals, reports</em>). If the site has a publically-searchable database (lots of court systems do), I might try to search by date rather than case number, if the system will let me. Then I just put in a large span of dates (cases in the last year, for instance) and see what the systems deliver. Or I could look for links to recent information and see if I can get lucky.</p>

<h2>On correspondence, private documents (contracts, etc), and incident, arrest, and other kinds of reports</h2>
 <p>I don't expect you to file and pay for Freedom of Information Requests, and it's understandably rare for people to post private or protected correspondence on the internet for anyone to access.</p><p> While I would not want to simply say "give up," if you're not networked with a professional or have professional experience as an employee, volunteer, or intern, private documents will be near-impossible to get hold of. </p><p>Thankfully, there are dozens of other genres that you can access when doing this research project.</p>
