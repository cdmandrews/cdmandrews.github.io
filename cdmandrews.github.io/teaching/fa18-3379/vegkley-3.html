<h1>How can I successfully bring food on my canoe trip?</h1>

<p>If you are planning to go on a long canoe trip, you have to have some sort of container to store food in. You will want to have all of the necessary materials in one storage container, so you don't have to worry about filling your canoe with extra boxes or bags. When planning out your food amounts, I always recommend that you prepare for at least three meals. This allows you to be prepared but still able to stop and replenish without having to worry about bringing too much. This is why you need a grub box.  </p>

<h2>How do I make a grub box for my canoe?</h2>
<p>When making your grub box, you have plenty of options. During construction, using wood to create your box will save you money as well as let you turn this into a DIY project that should last you quite a while if well maintained. However, if you are looking for a grub box that can withstand a lot of wear and use, I would recommend having a box made of tin or iron. But, you should keep in mind that the cost of tin or iron grub boxes is much higher than a wooden box. If you do choose to have a wooden grub box, there are a few things that it needs. Your box has to be water-tight so that your provisions and materials stay dry if the box gets wet. If you want your grub box to look finished, you can always paint it or cover it with boat varnish. </p>
<p>You may be looking for specific dimensions for your grub box, but the truth is that there is no true set size as your box must fit in your canoe. In order for you to figure out what the best size would be for your canoe and use, you have to first decide how much you want to store in your grub box. Then, measure the amount of storage space you have in your canoe. This would ensure that your box will fit within your canoe. When planning what to use for your grub box, you don't have to use any extremely heavy materials. If you are interested in making your grub box dual purpose, you should use heavier wood on both the top and bottom of the box to add more stability for seating as well as a thin strap for a handle on. If you simply want a storage box and not an extra seat, you can simply finish your box with a sturdy lid that can be fastened shut. </p>

<h2>How do I organize everything in my grub box?</h2>
<p>The best way to keep all your food and materials organized in your grub box is to use different water-tight tins or containers. You could also invest in containers that are part of a set, so they fit together neatly without wasting valuable space. I also recommend purchasing a large jar that will safely hold cool water. This will let you store butter without worrying about it melting in the heat.</p>

<h2>How do I decide what to put in the different containers?</h2>
<p>This is the easy part. After you've made or purchased your grub box and found all the containers you need to organize it, now you get to decide what goes where. If you have tins, these are the best for storing coffee, tea, sugar, flour, rice, and alcohol. Salt and pepper can be stored in smaller containers. If you are wanting to bring eggs with you, those should be stored in the sugar or flour tins to protect them from breaking. Any bread or bacon that you are wanting to bring should be wrapped in water-proof fabric and stored near the top of the box. Vinegar can be brought in a flask but be sure to clearly mark it, so you don't take a swig of the wrong one! If you are bringing canned goods, they can be kept in their original state. If you plan on packing onions, potatoes, or other vegetables for your meals, plan ahead and bring enough for at least three meals. Any extra food you bring can be stored in waterproof bags and distributed throughout the canoe. </p>

<h2>How do you make all this waterproof stuff?</h2>
<p>Water proof fabric is incredible for canoeing adventures. You can use it for clothing, blankets, as well as bags. The best thing about it? You can make all this yourself! If you are the DIY type, take unbleached muslin and, using a double row of stiches, sew it will a lap stich. Once they have been sewn, dip the fabric in water and shake to remove any drops. While it is still wet, brush the outside with an equal mixture of boiled oil, raw oil, and turpentine. Next, apply another coat without getting the fabric wet first. After that, leave it to dry for a few days. Now, you have the materials necessary for all kinds of waterproof containers, clothing, and blankets for your adventure. </p>

<h2>What are canoe ovens?</h2>
<p>A canoe oven is made of two stacking basins that do not seal completely so that it doesn't trap gas. These basins should be sturdy and made from strong sheet-iron which will make it both easy to clean and usable as bowls. As you will be using this for baking, do not store it in your grub box as it will cover everything with soot. You can purchase these stoves, but it is always my recommendation to not purchase or use oil stoves as they bring in some unnecessary dangers. </p>

<h2>What provisions are the best for my grub box?</h2>
<p>Besides what has already been mentioned, there are a few other foods that could be beneficial to bring.</p> 

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Self-rising flour</li>
<li>Canned tomatoes, corn, fruits, beans, soup, salmon, etc.</li>

<li>Sardines</li>
</ul>
