    <h1>The Perfect Food Box- A Canoer’s Guide to Eating on Your Cruise</h1>
    <h2>What is a Food Box and Why do I need one?</h2>
    <p>FOR canoe cruising a certain amount of food supplies and the necessary
      utensils for cooking should be carried in a single box or chest. This is
      for when you cook a meal on board you may have everything necessary for
      preparing a meal in one receptacle. Also when going ashore for your repast
      you can take in your hands everything you need in one journey. If on a
      long cruise the large portion of your food supply may be kept in different
      parts of the canoe, but the box should contain sufficient space for at
      least three meals, and can be replenished from the larger store when
      stopping for the night or at a camping place for any length of time. The
      larger the box that your stowage room will allow the greater comfort you
      will find. </p>
    <h2>How to build your own Food Box</h2>
    <p>The box may be made of wood, tin or galvanized iron. The wood option
      costs less and, can be made by the cruiser himself, and if properly made
      and properly taken care of, should answer the purpose. A box of either
      japanned or painted tin or galvanized iron will stand much knocking about
      without fracture, and is therefore preferable when its expense is no
      objection. Of course it must be water-tight, and if made of wood the
      nicest joining and dove-tailing must be done, and it should be varnished
      inside and out with shellac or boat varnish. Arbitrary dimensions cannot
      be given because of the varying sizes of canoes and the different amounts
      of provisions carried on cruises, therefore let each canoeist first
      determine what amount and variety of eatables they will carry, and then
      construct the box according to their needs, and stowage room in the
      cockpit.</p>
    <h3>Best Materials to Use</h3>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li>If made of wood quarter inch or 5/16 stuff (pine) will do, and if the
        box is to be used as a seat the top and bottom pieces should be heavier,
        say 3/8 of an inch.</li>
      <li>The cover should be two inches deep and the handle by which the box is
        carried should be a thin, wide, flat strap tacked to the cover.</li>
      <li>If the box is not used as a seat but is stowed under the deck it will
        be found an advantage to have the flanges of the cover fall over the
        side pieces of the box and the strap tacked to one end piece, carried
        over the cover and fastened by a hook to an eye in the other end piece
        in reach of the hand, so that the cover may be removed and articles
        obtained from the box without taking it from under the deck.</li>
      <li>If used as a seat the cover may be hinged on one side and two hooks
        fastened at the ends on the other, and for the back rest two pieces of
        three-quarter inch pine are screwed to the sides, running horizontally
        six or eight inches from the after most end of the box, holes being
        bored in them an inch apart "athwartship" and cut opposite each other,
        through which a quarter-inch brass rod is passed for the back rest to
        play on.</li>
      <li>As the lower end of the back rest strikes the end of the box near the
        floor when in use, it may be "slanted" as inclination demands by
        changing the brass rod from one set of holes to another.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make it Water Proof</h3>
    <p>To carry the provisions in the box so that they will not mix or spill,
      several water-tight tins should be used. The Consolidated Fruit Jar
      Company, 49 Warren Street, New York, makes tin screw-tops for jars and
      canisters that are perfectly water-tight. Send for several of these tops,
      of assorted sizes, and have a tinsmith make the tin cans of the dimensions
      you desire, so that they will nest in the box closely. The same company
      will also furnish you with a pint or quart earthen jar with water-tight
      screw-top, in which butter may be kept sweet for a long time in hot
      weather, and which may be enveloped in a net and lowered to the bottom of
      the river or lake without fear of its leaking.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>What is a canoe stove, and how can I make one?</h2>
    A canoeist's portable oven is made of two small basins, one of which has
    "ears" riveted to its rim, so that when it is placed bottom up on the other
    the ears will spring over the rim of the second basin, thus making an oven
    that is not air-tight, allowing gases to escape. The basins should be made
    of sheet-iron, and, as their interiors can easily be kept clean, they answer
    very well for soup dishes. Instructions for baking in them will be given
    later on. These should not go in the provision chest, as they will smut
    everything with which they come in contact. Butter, I have found, keeps
    better in its jar outside of the chest than in. Outside, too, are kept a
    small jug of molasses, and a jug of fresh water, if cruising on the "briny."
    There is no perfect canoe stove. The "flamme forcé" is probably as good as
    any. It takes up a little more room than the folding "pocket" variety, and
    it does not give more heat; but it burns for a longer time, and is not
    top-heavy when a heavy pot or pan is set on it. For cooking in large
    utensils have three of these flamme forcé alcohol lamps, light them and
    place them side by side, and you can cook in this way a dozen slapjacks at
    once on a big griddle, if you like. Danforth, the fluid man, makes a small
    canoe stove that would be preferable to all others if his fluid were
    obtainable at all the corners of the earth that canoeists frequent; but
    unfortunately it is not. Beware of "folding stoves" to use ashore and burn
    wood in. They are the greatest possible nuisances—smutty, red-hot and
    cumbersome. Don't carry an oil stove. But if you really must, put the nasty
    thing in a large bucket, and only remove it from this receptacle when
    absolutely necessary.

    <h2>Provisions that can be Included in the Food Box</h2>
    <p>Now as to eatables in general, besides what I have already mentioned, <em>condensed
        milk is a good thing</em>, but <strong>condensed coffee, condensed eggs
        and condensed beef are abominations</strong>. Self-raising or Hecker's
      prepared flour, wheat, rye, Indian or Graham, is easily made into bread
      and slapjacks. The directions come with the packages. Pilot bread will
      keep an indefinite time, and is not so unpalatable as hard-tack. Indian
      meal is very nutritious and easily made up, as it requires nothing to
      lighten it; scald it before using when it is not fresh. Canned tomatoes,
      corn, fruits, beans, soups, salmon, etc., are easy to prepare, and can be
      stored as ballast in the canoe. Mr. Hicks, of the Toronto Canoe Club,
      prepares certain kinds of food in cans for ballast as follows, according
      to the American Canoeist: "Get a number of flat square tin cans made like
      oyster cans, of a handy size to lie under your floor boards. Then cook a
      turkey, some chickens, a sirloin of beef, etc. Cut the hot meat up into
      large dice-shaped pieces, and put it in the tins hot, then pour melted fat
      in till the tins are full, and then solder them tight. Get as much meat in
      as you can before putting in the fat. Put up fruit in square flat cans in
      the same way. There is your ballast, and heavy stuff it is. When the
      provisions run short let the crew feed on the ballast. The preparation
      described is far more nutritious than canned corned beef, is more
      palatable, and will keep indefinitely—that is, throughout a very long
      cruise." <strong>I have not tried this method of preserving provisions</strong>,
      but the theory is excellent, and I do not see why it would not be a
      feasible scheme. The Brunswick canned soups are the cheapest made, are
      easily prepared and as wholesome as any; but I have known squeamish
      canoeists who would not use them because they didn't like the looks of the
      powder to which they are desiccated. Dried beef, corned beef, lemons and
      sardines make good additions to an outfit. Potatoes, onions and other
      vegetables should be procured en route as needed, if possible.</p>
    <h2>Just the Right Amount</h2>
    <p>As it may puzzle some neophytes to know how much of each article of food
      to take on a cruise, I give below the exact amount of provisions I carried
      on a cruise of a week last autumn. I did not run short of anything at the
      end of the week, but I had not provisions enough left for three square
      meals:<em> </em></p>
    <ul>
      <em>
        <li>1 lb. sugar (cut loaf)</li>
        <li>1/8 lb. tea</li>
        <li>1 lb. flour</li>
        <li>1-1/2 lbs. crackers</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. lard</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. rice</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. bacon</li>
        <li>3/4 lb. coffee</li>
        <li>1 lb. butter</li>
        <li>1 can condensed milk</li>
        <li>3 loaves bread</li>
        <li>3/4 peck potatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 peck meal</li>
        <li>1 pint molasses</li>
        <li>2 oz. pepper</li>
        <li>1 bottle pickles</li>
        <li>1 bottle yeast powder</li>
        <li>1 qt. salt</li>
      </em>
