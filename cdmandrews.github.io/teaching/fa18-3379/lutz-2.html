<h1>CANOE COOKERY SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>Below is a condensed and edited synopsis of the first chapter of <em>Canoe and camp cookery: A practical cook book for canoeists, Corinthian sailors, and outers</em> by H. H. Soulè (1885).

<p>Going on a canoe cruise can be a great adventure that allows you to reconnect with nature and escape from the busy world for a while. However, a great trip can be easily ruined if you are not fully prepared. Below you will find information on what to take to make sure you have enough food provisions and utensils for you cruise.</p>

<h2>THE BOX</h2>
<p>Each canoe cruise will require specific amounts of food supplies and cooking utensils to be brought along. The best way to store and transport your supplies is in a single box or chest because it keeps you organized and can be easily carried to and from your canoe if needed. The box should contain at least a day’s worth of food even if you replenish the supply from an additional, larger storage area every night.</p>

<h3>Building your box</h3>
<p>The material of your box depends on where you plan to store it and how high functioning you would like it to be, but as long as the box is water-tight, the choice is up to you. The three most common materials used are <strong>wood</strong>, <strong>tin</strong> or <strong>galvanized iron</strong>. The latter two metals cost more than the wood, but they can withstand more knocking around without damaging. However, building your own custom box out of wood is a good, cost efficient option.</p>

<p>Every canoe is different, so the size of your box will vary to fit customly. Also, your design can change if you store the box in the cockpit as opposed to using it as a seat. <em>Here are a few design tips that can help ensure your box functions as best as possible:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Seat Design</li>
	<ul>
	<li>quarter inch or 5/16 stuff (pine) is best; make the top and bottom pieces approx. 3/8 of an inch</li>
	<li>the cover should be two inches deep and a handle should be a thin, wide, flat strap tacked to the side</li>
	<li>the cover may be hinged on one side and two hooks fastened at the ends on the other</li>
	<li>a back rest made of two pieces of three-quarter inch pine can be screwed to the sides, running aft horizontally six or eight inches from the aftermost end of the box, holes being bored in them an inch apart "athwartship" and cut opposite each other, through which a quarter-inch brass rod is passed for the back rest to play on</li>
	<li>as the lower end of the back rest strikes the end of the box near the floor when in use, it may be "slanted" as inclination demands by changing the brass rod from one set of holes to another</li>
	</ul>
<li>Stowed Box Design</li>
	<ul>
	<li>quarter inch or 5/16 stuff (pine) is best
	<li>for this design it is easier to have the flanges of the cover fall over the side pieces of the box and the strap tacked to one end piece, carried over the cover and fastened by a hook to an eye in the other end piece</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<h3>Packing your box</h3>
<p>To best way to carry your provisions in the box so that they will not mix or spill, is to use several water-tight containers. <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank">The Container Store</a> is a great place to find multiple designs that will fit your needs. <em>Catering your containers to what they will hold greatly helps with organization:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>coffee, tea (or cocoa), sugar, flour (or meal), rice and alcohol</strong> may be carried in tin cans</li>
<li><strong>pepper and salt</strong> may be put in small spice boxes with two covers, the one underneath being perforated</li>
<li><strong>eggs</strong> are safest carried in the containers with the flour, coffee and rice</li>
<li><strong>bread and bacon (or salt pork)</strong> are wrapped in macintosh and put near the top of the chest</li>
<li><strong>vinegar</strong> may go in a whisky flask (mark it to avoid mistakes)</li>
<li><strong>canned goods (i.e. condensed milk, baking powder, etc.)</strong> may remain in their original cans</li>
</ul>

<p>The alcohol stove and utensils (i.e. cups, cutlery, plates, etc.) necessary to cook a meal should go in the box. <em>Here is a more detailed list of needed products:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>coffee pot</strong> should be of small size, with handle and lip riveted (if soldered, they are likely to melt off)</li>
<li><strong>cups or plates</strong> should be of tin or granite ware</li>
<li><strong>forks and knifes</strong> should have sheaths of leather inside the box cover (this leather can double as a handle cover for pots and pans)</li>
<li>the plates should nest in the <strong>frying pan,</strong> and be fastened inside the chest cover by two buttons for easy access</li>
<li>a three-quart <strong>tin or granite ware pail</strong> is necessary for stews, and two smaller ones may be nested in it, of two-quart and three-pint capacity, respectively</li>
<li><strong>butter</strong> keeps better in its jar outside of the chest than in</li>
<li>a small jug of <strong>molasses</strong> and a jug of <strong>fresh water</strong> are also best kept outside the box</li>
</ul>

<h2>THE FOOD</h2>
<p>The length of your journey will determine the type and amount of food you will need to pack. <em>Here is a sample packing list for a week-long journey:</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>1 lb. sugar (cut loaf)</li>
<li>1/8 lb. tea</li>
<li>1 lb. flour</li>
<li>1–1/2 lbs. crackers</li>
<li>1/2 lb. lard</li>
<li>1/2 lb. rice</li>
<li>1/2 lb. bacon</li>
<li>3/4 lb. coffee</li>
<li>1 lb. butter</li>
<li>1 can condensed milk</li>
<li>3 loaves bread</li>
<li>3/4 peck potatoes</li>
<li>1/2 peck meal</li>
<li>1 pint molasses</li>
<li>2 oz. pepper</li>
<li>1 bottle pickles</li>
<li>1 bottle yeast powder</li>
<li>1 qt. salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommended provisions</h3>
<p>There are a lot of quality brands and easily storable food items at your local grocery stores that you have to choose from. <em>Here is a few recommended provisions that have been tried and proven.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>self-raising or <strong>Hecker's</strong> prepared flour, wheat, rye, <strong>Indian</strong> or <strong>Graham</strong> is easily made into bread and slapjacks with the directions conveniently printed on the packages</li>
<li><strong>pilot bread</strong> will keep an indefinite time and is more palatable than hard-tack</li>
<li><strong>Indian meal</strong> is very nutritious and easily made up, as it requires nothing to lighten it; scald it before using when it is not fresh</li>
<li><strong>canned tomatoes, corn, fruits, beans, soups, salmon, etc.,</strong> are easy to prepare, and can be stored as ballast in the canoe</li>
<li><strong>dried beef, corned beef, lemons and sardines</strong> make good additions to an outfit</li>
<li><strong>potatoes, onions and other vegetables</strong> should be procured en route as needed, if possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, enough food for three meals should be kept in your box. The surplus supplies of provisions, such as <strong>vegetables, extra bread, crackers, flour, meal, pork or bacon, etc.,</strong> should be carried in waterproof bags and stowed wherever necessary to properly trim the canoe. These bags can also be used for clothing and blankets.</p>

<p>The bags we recommend are made of unbleached muslin, sewn in a lap seam, with a double row of stitches. When sewn they are dipped in water and slightly shaken to remove the drops, and then while wet a mixture of equal parts of boiled oil, raw oil and turpentine is applied to the outside with a brush. This takes about a week to become thoroughly dry, and then another coat is put on without dampening the cloth, and if a little liquid drier is added to the mixture, this coat will dry in four or five days.</p>

<p>Having prepared several bags, the provisions, clothing, blankets, etc., are put in the bag, and its mouth is inserted in that of another bag of the same size, the latter being drawn on like a stocking as far as it will go. If several bags are used instead of one or two large ones, the canoe can be trimmed and packed to better advantage.</p>

<h3>The canoeist’s portable oven</h3>
<p>A canoeist's portable oven is made of two small basins, one of which has “ears” riveted to its rim, so that when it is placed bottom up on the other the ears will spring over the rim of the second basin, making an oven that allows gases to escape. </p>

<p>The basins should be made of sheet-iron because then their interiors can easily be kept clean and are well suited for soup dishes. These should not go in the provision chest, as they will smut everything with which they come in contact.</p>

<p>There is no perfect canoe stove. The “flamme force” is a recognized brand but honestly just as good as any other. It takes up a little more room than the folding “pocket” variety, but it does not give more heat, only burns for a longer time.</p>

<p>For cooking in large utensils, have three of these flamme forcé alcohol lamps. You can light and place them side by side, cooking up to a dozen slapjacks in this manner.</p>

<p>Beware of "folding stoves" to use ashore and burn wood in. They are the greatest possible nuisances—smutty, red-hot and cumbersome. Also, don't carry an oil stove. But if you really must, put the nasty thing in a large bucket, and only remove it from this receptacle when absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3>THE ADVENTURE</h3>
<p>Now that you have made your box and packed it full of all the food provisions you will need from your journey, it's time to get out there and start cruising!
