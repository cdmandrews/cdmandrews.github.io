<h1>Scavenger Hunt</h1>

<p>I chose to do my family because I know them better than strangers, also some of my classmates. My parents have certain non-verbal cues I can always predict at certain times. When my mom is sad, and expressing something that is affecting her, she immediately goes to her room, and shits the door. When she finally comes out she usually does not make eye contact, and also choose to have an attitude in her tone of voice.  She doesn’t like talking unless she needs to, and she is really stand offish when she is like that. You can feel the intensity, and moment of breaking point is near when she is like this. </p>
<p>Another person I examined was my father. He exhumes the same characteristics tis time, he shows them more prevalent than my mother. He has a certain stern look in his gaze to where you know you shouldn’t interact with him right now. Mostly his body language is laid back, and cool. To which this is more frightening because you never know if you are going to get an ear full, or he is just in a relaxed state. His affect his usually stern.</p>
<p>What stood out me the most, is the eye contact from both parties. My mom hardly made eye contact when she was in an agitated state, which made me feel more unnoticed, but on my fathers’ side, his eye contact was unbearable. The polarization of these two plains was fascinating because of the two emotions given to me, ignore, and intensity. The specifics of my mom’s nonverbal behavior was to get away from everyone around her, and to let people know she did not want to be talked to at that time. </p>
