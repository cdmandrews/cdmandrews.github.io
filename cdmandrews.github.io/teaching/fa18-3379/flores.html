<h1>CANOE COOKERY!<h1/>
<h2>CHAPTER I. OUTFIT FOR COOKING ON A CRUISE.</h2>
<p>•	VALUE OF A SINGLE RECEPTACLE FOR EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO PREPARE A MEAL</P>
<p>o	For canoe cruising a certain amount of food supplies and the necessary utensils for cooking should be carried in a single box or chest. This allows the canoer ease of accessibility while on canoe, and embarking off the vessel.</p>
<p>o	If on a long cruise the large portion of his food supply may be kept in different parts of the canoe, but the box should contain sufficient for at least three meals, as well as a resupply when stopping.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER 2. THE CANOEIST'S "GRUB BOX."</h1>
<h2>The following represents the way a Canoe can be built, and will demonstrate examples</h2>
<p>The Rider should determine how much food, and what he is bringing on the cruise first, to determine the size, and materials one should use.</p>
<em><p>The box may be made out of wood, tin, or galvanized iron.</em></p>

•	Tin & Iron (costly, but extremely durable)

<strong> Must be water tight. </strong>
<p> Wood- Needs to be varnished inside and out, with detailed joining, and dove tailing.</p>
Details for using box as seat, and ingenuity.</p>
<h1>THE SAME AS A SEAT.</h1>

<h2>Deatils for using box as seat and ingenuity.</h2>

<p> •	The larger the box that his stowage room will allow, the greater the comfort of the canoeist.</p>

<p> •	If the box is to be used as a seat the top and bottom pieces should be heavier, about 3/8 of an inch.</p>

<p> •	The cover should be two inches deep and the handle by which the box is carried should be a thin, wide, flat strap tacked to the cover.</p>
<p> •	If used as a seat the cover may be hinged on one side with two hooks fastened at the ends of each other.</p>
•	The back rest will have two pieces of three-quarter inch pine which are screwed to the sides, running aft horizontally 6-8 inches from the furthest end of the box.
•	The canoer will drill holes an inch apart (athwartship) and cut opposite each other
•	Finally, a quarter-inch brass rod is passed for the back rest to play on.
o	If uncomfortable the brass rod may be moved to one set of holes interchangeably 
 </p>


<h1>CHAPTER 3. WATER-TIGHT TINS.</h1>
<p>•	To ensure contents will not spill, several water tight cans should be used.</p>
<p> •	If possible, “Consolidated Fruit Jar Company” sells and distributes near perfect water tight tins for you to choose. </p>
<p> •	Is you use this company, consult with the engineer to make your tins perfect dimension to fit within your box.</P>

<h1>CHAPTER 4. NECESSARY PROVISIONS AND UTENSILS</h1>

<h2>The rider should then choose what edibles they should pack, and plan accordingly.</h2>

<p>•	Some examples are coffee, tea (or cocoa), sugar, flour (or meal), rice and alcohol. (A special screw-top is made for fluid cans.)</p>

<p> •	Pepper and salt are packed in small spice boxes with two covers, the one underneath being perforated.</p>

<p> •	Eggs are the safest while carried in the tins with the flour, coffee and rice; bread and bacon (or salt pork) are wrapped in Macintosh and put near the top of the chest.</p>

<p> •	Vinegar goes in a distinguishable jar or flask (mark for no confusion).</p>

<p> •	Canned goods, condensed milk, baking powder, etc. should be in their own cans</p>

<p> •	Coffee pot, cup, fork, knife, spoon, frying pan and plates should be packed for cooking and made enough room for.</p>

<p>	The coffee pot should be of small size, with handle and lip riveted (Soldered handles usually melt off).</p>
<p> o	Cups or plates should be of tin or granite ware.</p>
ps or plates should be of tin or granite ware. 
o	The fork and knife have their sheaths of leather inside the box cover. 
o	The plates should nest in the frying pan 
o	The knife and fork have a sheath for a pair of small blacksmith's pliers.</p>


<H1>Chapter 5 WATERPROOF BAGS FOR PROVISIONS</H1>

<H2>The surplus supplies of provisions, such as vegetables, extra bread, crackers, flour, meal, pork or bacon, etc., should be carried in waterproof bags, and they can then be stowed wherever necessary to properly trim the canoe.</H2>
<p> •	These waterproof bags may be used also for clothing and blankets.</p>
<p> •	Items are put in the bag, and its mouth is inserted in that of another bag of the same size (pull, and tie second bag to carry around).</p>
<p><em> o	“If several bags are used instead of one or two large ones, the canoe can be trimmed and packed to better advantage.”</em> </p>


   <h1>Chapter 6 PORTABLE OVEN</h1>
	<em> <p> 	A canoeist's portable oven is made of two small basins, one of which has "ears" riveted to its rim.</em></p>
	
<p> •	The rivet design is used to allow gas to escape when cooking.</p>

<p><strong> •	The basins should be made of sheet-iron. (DO NOT PUT IN PROVISION CHEST!)</strong> </p>

<p> •	Keep meltables, and fragile items in side oven if need be. Molasses and sugar are kept out.</p>
	
<h1> Chapter 7 CANOE STOVE</H1>
<p> <strong> The best one on the market has to be the "flame force"</strong> </p>
•	Not too top heavy with pot on top, nor is it the bulkiest.
<p> •	Takes up a little room, also burns longer, but not hotter unfortunately </p>
•	Three of these flamme forcé alcohol lamps, light them and place them side by side

<h1> Chapter 8. FOLDING STOVES A NUISANCE.</h1>
<p> <strong> Beware of "folding stoves" to use ashore and burn wood in. They are the greatest possible nuisances—smutty, red-hot and cumbersome.</strong> </p>
<p> <em> (Don't carry an oil stove. But if you really must, put the nasty thing in a large bucket, and only remove it from this receptacle when absolutely necessary.)</p> </em>

<h1> Chapter 9. HINTS FOR PROVISIONING FOR A CRUISE.</h1>
<p> •	Hicks, of the Toronto Canoe Club, prepares certain kinds of food in cans for ballast as follows, according to the American Canoeist: "Get a number of flat square tin cans made like oyster cans, of a handy size to lie under your floor boards.</p>
<p> •	As it may puzzle some neophytes to know how much of each article of food to take on a cruise, I give below the exact amount of provisions I carried on a cruise of a week last autumn.</p> 
<p> •	butter; 1 can condensed milk; 3 loaves bread; 3/4 peck potatoes; 1/2 peck meal; 1 pint molasses; 2 oz.</p>
