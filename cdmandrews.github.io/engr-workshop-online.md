## Annotated lab reports

The two lab reports below were originally provided by Ronald Carson of the Mechanical Engineering program at TAMUCC. I removed student names and identifying information and added illustrative comments to each report. These are intended to accompany the video slideshow. Carlson also shared the "General Lab Report Guidlines," which have been attached here for convenience.

## Web resources for technical and scientific writing

Referred to in some of these materials:

- [Writing Lessons for Engineering and Science](https://www.craftofscientificwriting.com/) by Michael Alley.   
Variety of resources and slideshows, geared more towards instructors but useful to the technical and scientific writer.

- [Power Revision Techniques](https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/hirevov.html) by David McMurrey.   
Essential techniques for reviewing and revising your writing. McMurrey's site is a fairly comprehensive online tech writing textbook, geared towards writing students.
