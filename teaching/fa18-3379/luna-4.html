<h1> <strong>CANOE COOKERY: Tips for cooking on a canoe</strong></h1>
<body>
<h2>STORE EVERYTHING IN ONE BOX </h2>

<p>To cook on a canoe you're definitely going to need food supplies and utensils. It's best to try and carry everything in one box so that everything is grouped together. This will also make your supplies easy to carry when you go ashore.  

If you're going on a long cruise, it’s also a good idea to keep most of your food supplies in different parts of the canoe. The box should have enough supplies for at least three meals. You can replenish it with your larger supplies storage when you stop for the night or at a campsite. Keeping the larger box separate from the smaller box will make the cruise more comfortable.</p>
<strong>Box Tips: Size and Material</strong>
<ul>
<li>Your box could be made of wood, tin or iron. </li>
<li>Using wood can be less expensive and you can do it yourself if you want. </li>
<li>A box made out of iron or tin will be much more durable. </li>
<li>Make sure your box is water-tight (especially it is if made out of wood) </li>
<li>Pick a box that will fit comfortably in your canoe. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Making a Wooden Box</h2>
<h3>Materials:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/4 inch pine wood</li>
<li>Heavier pine wood for the bottom (if box will be used as a seat)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Measurements:</h3> 
<ul>
<li>	The cover: 2 inches deep</li>
<li>	The handle: Thin, wide, flat strap tacked to the cover</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pro-Tip:</h2> 
<p>If your box is going to be stored below-deck:</p>
<p>You can have the flanges of the cover fall over the sides of the box with the strap attached to one end and fastened to the other end by a hook. This way, you can remove the cover and take items out of the box without having to take the box out. </p>
<p>If your box will be used as a seat:</p>
<p>You can hinge the cover on one side, and have two hooks attached on that other end. For the back-rest, screw two pieces of ¾ inch pine to the sides. Run these horizontally six or eight inches from the farthest end of the box with holes one inch apart. Then, pass a ¼ inch brass rod through for the back-rest to play on. This will allow it to recline by changing the rod from one set of holes to another.</p> 

<h2>Storage Inside Your Box</h2>

<p>Use several water-tight tins so that nothing mixes or spills inside of the box. </p>
The Consolidated Fruit Jar Company in New York makes water-tight tin screw-tops for jars and canisters. You can order these tops, in assorted sizes, and have a someone make the tin cans in the sizes you want. They can also give you a pint or quart sized ceramic jar with a water-tight screw-top. This jar can keep butter safe for a long time in hot weather. You can lower it down in a net into the water without leaking.</p>

<h2>How to Store Food</h2>

<p>In the tin cans: </p>
 <ul>
<li>coffee </li>
<li>tea (or cocoa)</li>
<li>sugar </li>
<li>flour (or meal) </li>
<li>rice</li> 
<li>alcohol</li>
 </ul>
 <p> <strong> More storage tips. Store:</strong> </p>
 <ol>
<li>	Salt & pepper in small spice boxes with perforated bottoms (see image below)</li>
<li>	Eggs in the tins with flour, coffee and rice</li>
<li>	Wrapped bread & bacon near the top of the chest</li>
<li>	Vinegar in a marked whisky flask </li>
<li>  Canned goods in their own cans</li> 
</ol>

<h2>Packing List</h2>
<p> Make sure to pack all of these things for your trip: </p>
<ul>
<li>	Alcohol stove and cooking utensils </li>
<li>	Small coffee pot with a handle and riveted lip</li> 
<li>	Tin cups and plates</li>
<li>	Fork and knife sheaths </li>
<li>	Plates nesting in the frying pan</li>
<li>	Frying pan with no handle</li>
<li>	Knife and fork with a sheath </li>
<li>	Pair of small blacksmith's pliers to serve as a handle for frying pan </li>
<li>	A three-quart tin and two smaller ones nested in it </li>
<li>	Waterproof bags for extra food provisions, clothing, blankets. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Pro-Tip:</h2> 
<p>Using several bags instead of one or two large can save space. </p>

<h2>Ovens/Stoves: What You Need to Know </h2>
<p>A canoeist's portable oven is made of two small basins. One type has "ears" riveted to its rim. The basins should be made of sheet-iron so they are easy to keep clean. 
These should not go in the box, because they will dirty everything they in contact with. </p>
<p>There is no perfect canoe stove. The "flamme forcé" is good because it takes up a little more room than the folding type. It doesn't give more heat but it burns longer, and is not top-heavy when a heavy pot or pan is set on it. </p>
<p>For cooking in large utensils you should have three of these flamme forcé alcohol lamps, light them and place them side by side. </p>
<p>Folding stoves will get in your way, so avoid them and never carry an oil stove. If you feel like you absolutely have to bring a stove, put it in a large bucket, and only remove it when absolutely necessary.</p>

Canned tomatoes, corn, fruits, beans, soups, salmon, etc., are easy to prepare, and can be stored in the canoe. </p>
<p>Here is an example of how Mr. Hicks, from the Toronto Canoe Club, prepares certain kinds of food in cans:</p>
<p><em>"Get a number of flat square tin cans made like oyster cans, of a handy size to lie under your floor boards. Then cook a turkey, some chickens, a sirloin of beef, etc. Cut the hot meat up into large dice-shaped pieces, and put it in the tins hot, then pour melted fat in till the tins are full, and then solder them tight. Put up fruit in square flat cans in the same way.” - American Canoeist </em></p>
<p>I haven’t tried this myself, but it seems like a really good idea. The Brunswick canned soups are cheap, easy to prepare and very filling. However, not everyone likes them because of the powder that they dry to. Try adding dried beef, corned beef, lemons and sardines and gather potatoes, onions and other vegetables along the way if possible.</p>
