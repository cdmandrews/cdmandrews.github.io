	<h1> <em>Canoe Cookery</em> </h1>
	<h2>Storage Vessel</h2>
	<p>for setting out of a canoe trip you will want to be able to back equiptment for cooking.
	There are two popular vessels for storage: a Dry Bag or a Dry Box.  On this page we are going to be
	discussing a dry box.</p>
	<p>If you need assistance in deciding between the two follow this link to our friends at Autin Kayak.
	They have a ton of informaiton on making the right choice for your needs. <a href= "https://www.austinkayak.com/blog/2009/11/dry-bags-vs-dry-boxes-how-to-choose/"> Bag or Box?</a>

	<p>What you will need:</p>
	<ul type = "circle">
		<li>Propper outfit for a cruise</li>
		<li>Receptacle</li>

	<h2>Overview of the Box</h2>
	<p>For canoe cruising all the food, utensils, and equiptment should fit inside a <strong>single box</strong>.
	This will let you have a single recepticle for everything necessary for prepairing a meal.
	It is also helpful that all the needed supplies can be brought to and from the conoe in a single trip!</p>
	<p>It is advised that on day trips The Box should be able to carry at least 3 meals.</p>
	
	<p>The box may be made out of:</p>
	<ul type = "circle">
		<li>Wood</li>
		<li>Tin</li>
		<li>Galvanized Iron</li>
	</ul>
	<p>the material that the box is made from is compleatly up to the cruiser himself.
	The better the material, the longer it will last. However, well taken care of equitment will always last longer
	than equitment that is not taken care of propperly.</p>
	<h2> Storage </h2>
	<p>Once you know the material that you will use to build your box you will want to know what types
	of food you will be storing.  If you are storing food that needs to be air-tight such as: coffee, tea, or bread;
	you will want to make sure that the box is going to have a seal on it to make it waterproof.</p>
	<h2> Oven Cooking </h2>
	<p>A "flamme forcé" canoe stove is as good as any. It takes up a little more room than the folding variety, 
	and it does not give more heat; however, it burns for a longer time, and is not top-heavy when a heavy pot or pan is set on it. 
	For cooking larger amounts, have three of these flamme forcé alcohol lamps, light them and place them side by side, and you can 
	cook in this way a dozen slapjacks at once on a big griddle, if you like. BEWARE of "folding stoves"
	to use ashore and burn wood in. They are the greatest possible nuisances—smutty,
	red-hot and cumbersome. DO NOT carry an oil stove. </p>
	<h2>Advice</h2>
	<p>You should know how much good you will be wanting to take on the trips.  This will help
	with storage space and knowing how to organize.  Below I have listed everything that I take with me for a week:</p>
	<ul type = "circle">
		<li>1/8 lb. tea</li>
		<li>1 lb. flour </li>
		<li>1-1/2 lbs. crackers</li>
		<li>1/2 lb. lard</li>
		<li>1/2 lb. rice</li>
		<li>2 oz. pepper</li>
		<li>3/4 lb. coffee</li>
		<li>1 bottle yeast powder</li>
		<li>1 qt. salt</li>
	</ul>
