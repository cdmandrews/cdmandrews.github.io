<h1>CANOE COOKERY SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>Below is a condensed and edited synopsis of the first chapter of <em>Canoe and camp cookery: A practical cook book for canoeists, Corinthian sailors, and outers</em> by H. H. Soulè (1885). Full text is available from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/55705/55705-h/55705-h.htm#Page_9">The Gutenberg Project.</a></p>


<h2>THE BOX</h2>
<p>Each canoe cruise will require specific amounts of food supplies and cooking utensils to be brought along. The best way to store and transport these supplies is in a single box or chest because it keeps you organized and is easily portable in case you camp on land for any portion of your trip. The box should contain at least a day’s worth of food even if you replenish the supply from a larger storage area every night.</p>

<h3>Building your box</h3>
<p>The material of your box depends on where you plan to store it on your canoe and how high functioning you would like it to be, but as long as the box is water-tight, the choice is up to you. The three most common materials used are <strong>wood</strong>, <strong>tin</strong> or <strong>galvanized iron</strong>. The latter two metals cost more than the wood, but they can withstand more knocking around without damaging. However, building your own custom box out of wood is a good option with a large scope of variation.</p>

<p>Every canoe is different so the size of your box will vary. Also, your design can change if you store the box in the cockpit as opposed to using it as a seat. <em>Here are a few design tips that can help ensure your box functions as best as possible:</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>quarter inch or 5/16 stuff</strong> (pine) is best; if used as seating, make the top and bottom pieces approx. 3/8 of an inch</li>
<li>the <strong>cover</strong> should be two inches deep and a handle should be a thin, wide, flat strap tacked to the side</li>
<li>if the cover is for a <strong>stowed box</strong> it is easier to have the flanges of the cover fall over the side pieces of the box and the strap tacked to one end piece, carried over the cover and fastened by a hook to an eye in the other end piece</li>
<li>if used as a <strong>seat</strong> the cover may be hinged on one side and two hooks fastened at the ends on the other; a back rest made of two pieces of three-quarter inch pine can be screwed to the sides, running aft horizontally six or eight inches from the aftermost end of the box, holes being bored in them an inch apart "athwartship" and cut opposite each other, through which a quarter-inch brass rod is passed for the back rest to play on. As the lower end of the back rest strikes the end of the box near the floor when in use, it may be "slanted" as inclination demands by changing the brass rod from one set of holes to another as in figure 1.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Packing your box</h3>
<p>To carry the provisions in the box so that they will not mix or spill, several water-tight tins should be used. The Consolidated Fruit Jar Company, 49 Warren Street, New York, makes tin screw-tops for jars and canisters that are perfectly water-tight and will also furnish you with a pint or quart earthen jar with water-tight screw-top, in which butter may be kept sweet for a long time in hot weather, and which may be enveloped in a net and lowered to the bottom of the river or lake without fear of leaking. <em>Catering your tin designs to what they will hold greatly helps with organization:</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>coffee, tea (or cocoa), sugar, flour (or meal), rice and alcohol</strong> may be carried in tin cans</li>
<li><strong>pepper and salt</strong> may be put in small spice boxes with two covers, the one underneath being perforated</li>
<li><strong>eggs</strong> are safest carried in the tins with the flour, coffee and rice</li>
<li><strong>bread and bacon (or salt pork)</strong> are wrapped in macintosh and put near the top of the chest</li>
<li><strong>vinegar</strong> may go in a whisky flask (mark it to avoid mistakes)</li>
<li><strong>canned goods (i.e. condensed milk, baking powder, etc.)</strong> may remain in their original cans</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The alcohol stove and utensils necessary to cook a meal should go in the box, such as coffee pot, cup, fork, knife, spoon, frying pan and plates. <em>Here is a more detailed list of the aforementioned products:</em>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>coffee pot</strong> should be of small size, with handle and lip riveted (if soldered, they are likely to melt off)</li>
<li><strong>cups or plates</strong> should be of tin or granite ware</li>
<li><strong>forks and knifes</strong> should have sheaths of leather inside the box cover (this leather can also be used as a handle cover to lift pots and pans)</li>
<li>the plates should nest in the <strong>frying pan,</strong> which should have no handle, and is fastened inside the chest cover by two buttons, so that it may be readily released</li>
<li>a three-quart <strong>tin or granite ware pail</strong> is necessary for stews, and two smaller ones may be nested in it, of two-quart and three-pint capacity, respectively</li>
<li><strong>butter</strong> keeps better in its jar outside of the chest than in</li>
<li>a small jug of <strong>molasses</strong> and a jug of <strong>fresh water</strong> are also best kept outside the box</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>THE FOOD</h2>
<p>The length of your journey will determine the amount of food you will need to pack. <em>Here is a sample packing list for a week-long journey:</em>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><strong>1 lb. sugar (cut loaf)</li>
<li>1/8 lb. tea</li>
<li>1 lb. flour</li>
<li>1–1/2 lbs. crackers</li>
<li>1/2 lb. lard</li>
<li>1/2 lb. rice</li>
<li>1/2 lb. bacon</li>
<li>3/4 lb. coffee</li>
<li>1 lb. butter</li>
<li>1 can condensed milk</li>
<li>3 loaves bread</li>
<li>3/4 peck potatoes</li>
<li>1/2 peck meal</li>
<li>1 pint molasses</li>
<li>2 oz. pepper</li>
<li>1 bottle pickles</li>
<li>1 bottle yeast powder</li>
<li>1 qt. salt</strong></li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Recommended provisions</h3>
<ul>
<li>self-raising or <strong>Hecker's</strong> prepared flour, wheat, rye, <strong>Indian</strong> or <strong>Graham</strong> is easily made into bread and slapjacks with the directions conveniently printed on the packages</li>
<li><strong>pilot bread</strong> will keep an indefinite time and is more palatable than hard-tack</li>
<li><strong>Indian meal</strong> is very nutritious and easily made up, as it requires nothing to lighten it; scald it before using when it is not fresh</li>
<li><strong>canned tomatoes, corn, fruits, beans, soups, salmon, etc.,</strong> are easy to prepare, and can be stored as ballast in the canoe</li>
<li><strong>dried beef, corned beef, lemons and sardines</strong> make good additions to an outfit</li>
<li><strong>potatoes, onions and other vegetables</strong> should be procured en route as needed, if possible</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, enough food for three meals should be kept in your box. The surplus supplies of provisions, such as <strong>vegetables, extra bread, crackers, flour, meal, pork or bacon, etc.,</strong> should be carried in waterproof bags and stowed wherever necessary to properly trim the canoe. These bags can also be used for clothing and blankets.</p>

<p>They are made of unbleached muslin, sewn in a lap seam, with a double row of stitches. When sewn they are dipped in water and slightly shaken to remove the drops, and then while wet a mixture of equal parts of boiled oil, raw oil and turpentine is applied to the outside with a brush. This takes about a week to become thoroughly dry, and then another coat is put on without dampening the cloth, and if a little liquid drier is added to the mixture, this coat will dry in four or five days.</p>

<p>Having prepared several bags, the provisions, clothing, blankets, etc., are put in the bag, and its mouth is inserted in that of another bag of the same size, the latter being drawn on like a stocking as far as it will go. If several bags are used instead of one or two large ones, the canoe can be trimmed and packed to better advantage.</p>

<h3>Cooking: the canoeist’s portable oven</h3>
<p>A canoeist's portable oven is made of two small basins, one of which has “ears” riveted to its rim, so that when it is placed bottom up on the other the ears will spring over the rim of the second basin, making an oven that allows gases to escape. </p>

<p>The basins should be made of sheet-iron because then their interiors can easily be kept clean and are well suited for soup dishes. Instructions for baking in them will be given later on. These should not go in the provision chest, as they will smut everything with which they come in contact.</p>

<p>There is no perfect canoe stove. The “flamme force” is probably as good as any. It takes up a little more room than the folding “pocket” variety, but it does not give more heat only burns for a longer time.</p>

<p>For cooking in large utensils have three of these flamme forcé alcohol lamps, light them and place them side by side, and you can cook in this way a dozen slapjacks at once on a big griddle, if you like. Danforth, the fluid man, makes a small canoe stove that would be preferable to all others if his fluid were obtainable at all the corners of the earth that canoeists frequent; but unfortunatel, it is not.</p>

<p>Beware of "folding stoves" to use ashore and burn wood in. They are the greatest possible nuisances—smutty, red-hot and cumbersome. Also, don't carry an oil stove. But if you really must, put the nasty thing in a large bucket, and only remove it from this receptacle when absolutely necessary.</p>
