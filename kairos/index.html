<h3>A short guide for first-time webtext book reviewers</h3>
	<p>This guide is intended for first-time webtext authors submitting to the Reviews section. Book reviews are a commonly-assigned and frequently-written genre, but ironically it is not necessarily a genre that instruction is often provided for. This is true for webtext reviews as well. Working in a new medium can be challenging, and in the interest of helping mentor first-time review authors, we prepared this guide. A key passage from Kairos' <a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/submissions.html">submission guidelines</a> describes what we're <strong>not</strong> looking for:</p>
		<blockquote>We’re not looking for a standard, text-based article written in a word processing program such as Microsoft Word or a similar program. We don't accept traditional print essays. Because the work we publish integrates rhetoric, design, and code to produce a scholarly argument that is instantiated in the use of media and design, we also have fairly specific technical requirements (e.g. we typically don't accept work produced in proprietary formats or systems—like iWeb or Wix). Please see the Kairos Style Guide for details.</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/styleguide.html">Kairos style guide</a> reviews design and coding requirements that will help keep your webtext rhetorical, accessible, usable, and sustainable. We recognize that for many first-time webtext authors, our design, coding, and sustainability requirements represent a big learning curve:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>We need to be able to archive everything we publish, so we <strong>cannot accept webtexts hosted on third-party sites</strong> like WIX, Weebly, and Adobe Spark.</li>
	<li>We no longer accept webtexts in WordPress, or those composed in Adobe MUSE.</li>
	<li>We strongly encourage authors to use <strong>standard, non-proprietary formats</strong> (HTML 5, CSS, etc.) rather than Flash or other embedded proprietary media or template engines.</li>
    </ul>
<p>With that in mind, this page is intended to be a resource for getting started creating your webtext for the first time. [sometihng welcoming and nice here about chatting up editors and yay feedback]:</p>
<h4>Resources for getting started</h4>
  <p>Resources for getting started with HTML5 &amp; CSS: First-time authors should definitely check out the introductory tutorials and topics on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Mozilla Developer Network</a>. The "Introduction to HTML" is required reading!</p>
	<p>If you've never written for the web before, the following books are worth spending time with:</p>
<ul>
		<li><cite>Letting Go of the Words</cite> by Ginny Redish is an exccellent overall guide to web writing, structure, and style</li>
  <li><cite>How to write and design web pages today</cite> by Karl Stolley is a thoughtful technical resource for beginning and advanced web authors</li>
	</ul>
<p>Sadly, there aren't many great free WYSIWYG editors out there these days. Many universities provide access to Adobe Dreamweaver, but not all web authors have access to fully-functional web suites. There are <strong>free (and good quality) text editors</strong>, however. You might find any one of the following useful for working on your text's code alongside the MDN introductions to HTML and CSS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>atom.io</li>
      <li>brackets</li>
      <li>BBedit</li>
      <li>notepad++</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Avoiding common technical and design issues</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Many authors use markup tags incorrectly, either using the wrong tag for the job or applying them decoratively instead of semantically. For example, authors should choose h1-h6 because of their structure, rather than their displayed style. Headings and subheadings should be marked up with h tags, rather than using bolded paragraph text to indicate subheadings.</li>
      <li>Many authors use inline styles instead of external stylesheets. While small things inevitably slip in, try to put all style information on an external stylesheet.</li>
      <li>Many authors need to break up walls of words. Incorporate overt structural elements (i.e. subheadings or splitting or modularizing content into different pages or sections) and work to make reviews fully multimodal (i.e. color, type, spacing, layout, images and media) to take advantage of the affordances of digital publication. This doesn't just mean loading your webtext up with pictures--there are many design principles and variables you can work with to make your argument.</li>
  </ul>
<h4>Getting beyond the chapter-by-chapter summary</h4>
<p>Many of the drafts we see--in particular reviews of edited collections--follow a typical pattern. An introductory home page, a series of pages devoted to individual sections, and a concluding page. Pages are often titled "Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3," and so forth. Indeed, if you dig through the <a>Kairos review archives </a>you'll find examples that do just that. These webtexts essentially take a book review manuscript written in a word processor and break that text up into five or so sequential pages, with little to distinguish it as a webtext--i.e. something that tries to take advantage of the web and multimodality that can do things differently than printed text on a page (or digital text on a pdf version).</p>
<p>These webtexts commonly offer a synopsis of the book a chapter at a time for the largest portion of the review. The weakness of this tyle of review is that often these drafts don't effectively describe the book as a whole or reflect patterns and relationships in the text beyond what's already been suggested in the book's own table of contents. These relationships are valid, but the job of a book reviewer is to go beyond summarizing the contents of a book and say what's good (or not) about a text? What does it do? What does it add? What is absent? Who needs this book, and why? What can they do with it? Why do you HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK OMG?</p>
    <p>The other weakness in the chapter trudge is that it lends itself to those sequential pages. The text might as well appear as a pdf! So, what are other possibilities for the genre?</p>
  <p>Also, there's no rule that says your webtext must be all HTML pages--what about a video? a podcast or series of audioclips? an accessible infographic? a prezi? something we haven't seen yet? A simple single-page HTML shell would be enough to get those ready for publication. (Just don't forget to <strong>create transcripts or accessible text for everything</strong>!)</p>

<h3>kooky examples and what works (note: need to refine, categorize by kinks and kooks.)</h3>

      <li>again, a single author piece, so this is easier. Does include an outline of the book, but the review itself is focused on the big concepts and important ideas (and gives examples)</li>
      <li>lots of visuals</li>

      <li>does roughly follow section breakdown of the book, doesn't fall into chapter divisions too hard--uses larger ideas rather than chapters to break down webtext</li>
      <li>map visualization (not perfect, but a mediation of the book)</li>

<h4>"H-Net Book Reviews: Enhancing Scholarly Communication with Technology". Eileen L. McGrath, Winifred Fordham Metz, &amp; John B. Rutledge. (2005). College &amp; Research Libraries 66.1. Retrieved from <a href="https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/15704/17150">https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/15704/17150</a></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Compares book reviews on H-Net (on H-South) and print reviews in The Journal of Southern History (JoSH).</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>In the humanities, book reviews often occupy a third or more of a journal's page. The reasons for writing reviews are myriad. Scholars often write reviews to participate in their discipline's dialogue. to keep their names before their peers, or simply to boost their number of publications. They read reviews to learn of new books as well as to see how their peers receive other scholars' ideas.  (p. 8)</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Show significant differences in academic status of reviewers: Grad students and junior faculty wrote most H-South reviews, while senior faculty wrote more than two-thirds of SoSH reviews. Asking if younger or more senior scholars would be more critical, this analysis shows that neither is true. Recognizing that most reviews tend to be positive (though with variations in degree of enthusiasm) assessment of quality in H-South and JoSH reviews was about the same.</li>
    <li>E-Reviews are significantly longer than print reviews (average lengths of e-reviews was three times the average length of print).</li>
    <li>E-reviews showed a marked tendency to detail the contents of a book chapter by chapter (in a few cases, evaluative comments were so oblique that the researchers had to read very closely to determine the reviewer's opinion). The convenience of e-reviews may be undermined by their length. If a book review is bland and lacks critical assessment of the book, it may be of limited usefulness.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>Reading an e-review was very much like reading a synopsis or a linear rehearsal of the arguments, findings, and overall content of the book. In some cases, the evaluative function of a book review seemed subordinate to the reporting function. [...] Some readers will find these long, detailed, but essentially descriptive reviews valuable. A bibliographer with responsibility for a focused collection will find the H-Net type of review most helpful. [...] However, mere description falls short of the intellectual dialogue necessary for the education of the discipline. (17)</blockquote>
  <blockquote>The chief advantage of reviews such as those examined on H-Net is that librarians and scholars can get a good sense of what the book being reviewed contains. The disadvantage is that reporting about content can replace a genuinely critical evaluation. (p. 17)</blockquote>
  <blockquote>By convention, a book review is a terse, tightly constructed and condensed form of communication. (p. 17)</blockquote>
  <p>My take: When dealing with edited collections, it might be especially tempting to overview EVERYTHING. Stick to main themes of the book. Why is the work relevant now? What are the outstanding (or less outstanding) contributions in an edited collection?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Nothing especially surprising in her overview of book review structure, and it of course mostly speaks to the structure of print reviews, but a useful heuristic for thinking an evaluation through.</li>
    <li>Brienza breaks down the traditional structure of academic book reviews: Introduction, Summary of argument, About the author(s), Summary of contents, Strength, Weakness, and Conclusion.</li>
    <li>I would add academic context/contributions to the field to this list. You should be able to talk about how/where the work fits in the field and what contributions it is making.</li>

<ul>
    <li>The guide discusses the purposes of a book review, and the heuristic for "Critical or essay-length book reviews" would be particularly useful.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>The task of the book reviewer is to “tease out” the book’s themes, explain them in the review, and apply a well-argued judgment on the appropriateness of the book’s argument(s) to the existing scholarship in the field.</blockquote>
