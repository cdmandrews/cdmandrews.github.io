<h1>In case you were feeling nostalgic.<br>
An occasional poem.</h1>

<p>In case you were feeling nostalgic<br>
about dinnertime<br>
with your children.</p>

<p>In particular, </p>

<p>In case you were feeling cats-in-the-cradle<br>
about missed time<br>
with your loving children,</p>

<p>let me tell you a story. </p>

<h2>4:45 pm</h2>
<p>Sidney and Haley come over<br>
from next door<br>
with Flamin Hot (TM) Cheetos.<br>
Your neverending hungerbucket<br>
just had to have some. </p>

<p>When rebuffed, he came trolling <br>
the pantry<br>
for snacks.</p>

<p>Frieda sees me chopping calabaza<br>
and declares she will <br>
NOT<br>
eat <br>
potatoes.</p>

<h2>5:00 pm</h2>
<p>I chase the neverending hungerbucket<br>
O.<br>
U.<br>
T. <br>
of the pantry<br>
for snacks.</p>

<p>He screams with firey face,<br>
stork's bite aglow <br>
with the intensity of his age.</p>

<p>I tell him to go upstairs.<br>
NOOOOOOOO</p>

<p>Five.</p>

<p>Four.</p>

<p>Three.</p>

<p>Two.</p>

<p>One and a third.</p>

<p>One and one half.<br>
(Have I lost the ability to count so soon in the summer?)</p>

<p>One and one quarter.</p>

<p>One.</p>

<p>NOOOOOOOOOOO</p>

<p>I lift the two ton<br>
squirming<br>
neverending hungerbucket<br>
and deposit him <br>
upon Transformer sheets<br>
and instruct him to undergo a similar transformation.</p>

<h2>5:15 pm</h2>

<p>I WANNA PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH.</p>

<p>You can have one at dinner time.</p>

<p>I WANNA PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH NOW.</p>

<p>Asked and answered.</p>

<p>I WANNA--</p>

<p>ASKED AND ANSWERED. </p>

<p>YOU ARE MAKING ME SO MAD.</p>

<p>YOU ARE MAKING *ME* SO MAD.</p>

<p>Not even Cormac McCarthy could sort out this dialogue.</p>

<h2>5:30 pm</h2>

<p>I call Frieda and the neverending hungerbucket in to the kitchen.<br>
with great gusto</p>

<p>Frieda, realizing the potatoes are baked<br>
not roasted with sausage and carrots<br>
not dripping in blood and ooze<br>
not parboiled with brains<br>
or cooked in a death sauce with pestilence<br>
on the side,<br>
happily orders a potato<br>
with cheese<br>
NO butter.</p>

<p>Adalaide, <br>
who happily scrubbed<br>
and poked<br>
and wrapped<br>
and ovened the potatoes with me<br>
In an apalling, unexpected, and happy moment of consistency<br>
happily orders a potato<br>
with cheese <br>
(lots)<br>
NO butter. <br>
But sure, bacon is okay, daddy.</p>

<p>All this time, the neverending hungerbucket<br>
is collecting materials to construct<br>
his PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH NOW.</p>

<p>The PEANUT BUTTER is low, so he needs help.<br>
I comply, swiftly<br>
slapping it onto a slice of bread.<br>
Then gently jiggling the jelly<br>
out onto its mate.</p>

<h2>5:45 pm</h2>
<p>(or thereabouts)<br>
I finally finish creating my masterwork baked potato.<br>
A steaming bed of cotton-light Idaho glory<br>
Dripping with (I don't think it's really) butter<br>
A bit of salt<br>
A bit more of pepper<br>
C<br>
H<br>
E<br>
E<br>
E<br>
S<br>
E<br>
A handful of grilled sliced onions, golden yellow and brown and <br>
just slightly crispy on one side<br>
Then to top it off, bacon bits.</p>

<p>Nay, not those maltodextrin-infused<br>
soy powder bits,<br>
injected with FD&C Red 40.</p>

<p>No, REAL Bacon. <br>
Heated to glorious crispitude in cast iron.<br>
Crumbled gently into tiny bits.<br>
Refrigerated until just<br>
this <br>
moment.</p>

<p>It was beautiful.</p>

<h2>5:51 pm</h2>

<p>DADDY I WANT A POTATO NOW.</p>

<p>I sigh. Contemplating<br>
the first bite<br>
that I haven't yet taken.</p>

<p>Are you sure?</p>

<p>YES<br>
says the hungerbucket.</p>

<p>Fine.<br>
That potato is too hot to eat anyway<br>
curls of steam rising sinfully up to heaven<br>
like the taunting tail of a cigarette end.</p>

<p>I go into the kitchen,<br>
expectancy and hunger inside me <br>
and beside me.</p>

<p>I cut the potato in half.<br>
I remove the devil skin.<br>
I begin to chop the just-right soft potato.</p>

<p>DADDY I DONT WANT A POTATO I WANT<br>
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY.</p>

<p>And with that, I go.<br>
I sit down.<br>
And I eat my potato.</p>

<h2>6:08 pm</h2>

<p>I am coming to the end. It was a wonderful time. My expectations for this rare baked potato night have been entirely fulfilled. I cooked them at the right temperature and for the right time, I got just enough (not too much) butter, made sure everyone had enough cheese, and the grilled onions really made the cold bacon pieces work. </p>

<p>And a happy accident: the calabaza squash I roasted (olive oil and sea salt; red pepper flakes on a small portion) and ate alongside the potato became a happy accident; the red pepper flakes and vegetable flavors popped right into the potato. </p>

<p>It was a glorious affair.</p>

<p>DADDY I WANT A PEANUT BUTTER AND--</p>

<p>CRASH.</p>

<p>The shatter of glass tears me away from the final two bites. <br>
A pinprick of blood from a jar dropped onto saltillo tile must be dealt with.<br>
And I contemplate the last nibbles of bacon and cheddary bliss<br>
sweeping up the shards of my evening<br>
and wondering if I'll get all the jelly up<br>
or if the ants will get to have theirs tonight, too.</p>
