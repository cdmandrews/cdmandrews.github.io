-- do something with the idea for emoji proposal papers?

-- see Jones & Walton (table and end materials) in Key Theoretical Frameworks

-- Change up chapter 8 assignment--turn it into a case study of seeing multiple types of reporting (informal, formal) and related genres (press release, etc.) and how they relate/work together; chained literacy events perhaps? Importance of understanding audience and purpose when reading (and evaluating) a document--how your understanding of the document is affected by your knowledge of audience and purpose.

### fix up lecture/recordings for:

	- memos and correspondence (follow pptx)
	- headings/subheadings
	- others for first part of the semester?


### dress out journal entries for workplace writing journal:
	1. id people you could interview
	2. email dos and don'ts
	3. reporting, search/sources for info?
	4. school rules for writing they still rely on or have forgotten about?
	5. 2-3 examples of workplace writing in your field & completion of power searching course @ google.


### new and crazy idea: make a fact sheet, based on

![Fact sheet and research idea handwritten note](3301-idea.jpeg)

### push more lit review in reports--include a more formal research component, and revisit tengrrl materials;  pull executive summary and focus on summary in introduction piece.

- early assignment---locate some articles online (blog pots and professional websites are fine) that summarize or describe writing in a career you're interested in. Read those articles, and summarize them--in particular, the major ideas and specific advice they offer about professional writing.

- 'nother assignment--have students collaborate to write a blog post about some aspect of writing in thur field. Start a multi-semester course blog that groups of students can contribute to. Genre spotlights? Reports of interviews? Some summary of writing advice? Got to be well-researched.

### COURSE MANUAL

# More 3301 notes

JUST TOO MUCH IN THE MAIN MENU

## Notes for "Analyzing Style" heuristic.

Cut out redundancies (aka "concise, brief, or complex?"). Add helpful thinking questions along the way.

## Readings?

Include sets of readings about workplace writing in multipel contexts.

Especially "Write for hire" essay from Cs.

Myths of writing?

## Archive

Begin an archive approach to student writing--have them locate and dump examples. (Students vote on them? Susan does this)

Alternatively, more research guides--have students take the Google Power Searching class (FOR CREDIT, BEFORE PROJECT 1)

Disney research pubs: https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/

## Interview project

Need to ball up and have students do a professional writing interview project--structured interview, w/pre-set questions, turn into a memo report

Work from "most important genres for tc workers" article (BLythe, Lauer, & Curran, TCQ); consider having students combine/compile results of interview data into vizzes? (oooh, cool).

## Presentations and modalities for the final project

Make final project a powerpoint or (other software) presentation, then a write-up of that presentation?

The assertion-evidence model is more comprehensible for audiences than the topic model. Build your talk on messages, not topics, to tell a short and compelling story about your work. You then support messages with visual evidence (not bullet lists).

What's the story of your research? What are your assertions?

## Discussion assignments:

From the (twitter) news: I successfully used Twitter in the past as an ethics component of the course that gets students thinking about rhetorical, (cultural, ethical, and global) contexts of technical and written communication. Students had to post on trending current news stories or web sources with a prompt driven description on topics aligned with course modules. My students always expressed liking this assignment because it got them thinking about approaches to written communication from a real world perspective.


make new "learning online activities" assignment to replace the crappy IOL form.
