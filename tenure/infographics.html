<h2>Selected infographics for rhetorical analysis project.
<br> ENGL 4320: Writing for Social Media (Summer 2018)</h2>
<p>Students analyzed the rhetorical situation of any digital social media text of their choice. They were to identify human and nonhuman actors, purposes, contexts, and attributes of delivery, circulation, and reproduction, analyze them (with the help of course texts and discussion content), and then present their analysis in an infographic, slideshow, or other shareable visualization. Overall, they were to examine the complexity of the rhetorical situation and get a sense of how rhetors look forward to and anticipate the nature of circulation they desire for their compositions. </p>
<p>These three writers used a variety of multimodal composing strategies to create compelling, accessible, and shareable infographics that external audiences could understand.</p>
