<p><strong><font size="+2">Writing Project</font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Professionals in your field</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To develop an extended project related to your field 
  of study that will contribute to your academic or professional career.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment: </strong>Early in the semester, identify an issue/need/gap 
  within your field of study or your profession that you can address through writing. 
  Then develop a writing project that will address this need and take the form 
  of a recognized academic or professional genre. Most of the work you do in this 
  class will relate directly to this project.</p>
<p>The following are some suggestions for Writing Project formats:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Conference Paper</li>
  <li> Thesis/Dissertation (or chapter of)</li>
  <li>Literature Review</li>
  <li> Journal Article</li>
  <li> Quantitative/Qualitative Report</li>
  <li> Annual Report</li>
  <li> Grant Proposal</li>
  <li> Textbook Chapter</li>
  <li> Training Documents </li>
</ul>
<p>A typical class research paper is NOT an acceptable genre for this assignment. 
  You are not simply showing your knowledge of the field; you are contributing 
  to the knowledge of the field. The genre you choose must have a professional 
  context, not just be an academic exercise. Do not use a term paper from another 
  class unless you are revising it into a professional document.</p>
<p>Throughout the semester, you will work on your Writing Projects individually 
  and in groups. Final projects will not be considered for a grade unless you 
  have worked on them throughout the semester during the Writing Workshop activities. 
  In other words, if you work on a project throughout the semester and then decide 
  the last week of class to turn in a completely different project, the work will 
  not be accepted. The emphasis in this class is on the process of putting together 
  a project, not just turning in a final document for a grade. A project proposal 
  is due early in the semester. You may not significantly change your topic once 
  this proposal has been approved.</p>
<p>For English MA students interested in community college teaching: Community 
  colleges (including Del Mar) are becoming more strict about their instructors 
  having education and experience in the teaching of basic writing. TAMUCC only 
  offers one course in basic writing; the new standard is to have three on your 
  transcript. Del Mar, however, seems willing at this time to accept a major project 
  focused on basic writing in another class as a substitute for one of those three 
  courses. Thus if you are interested in community college teaching as a career, 
  you may wish to consider pursuing basic writing as a topic for your project.</p>
