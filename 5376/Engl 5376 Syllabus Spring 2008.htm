<p><strong>Course Policies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Attendance: </strong>This class is conducted as a workshop, so your 
  learning and the learning of your classmates relies on your regular attendance 
  and participation. Note above that workshop activities account for nearly 1/3 
  of your grade. Our class meetings are times for writing and productive collaboration: 
  working together, helping each other, learning from each other. Therefore, if 
  you miss more than 2 class meetings, no matter what the reason, your final grade 
  will be lowered one letter grade for each day missed after 2. To be counted 
  present, you must be on time and remain in class until it is dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations: </strong>We will treat our writing community as a professional 
  work setting. Each members is expected to be prepared, to do the assigned readings/writings/discussions, 
  and to have work ready for peers to respond to. &quot;Professional&quot; also 
  means that late work is not acceptable for any reason.</p>
<p><strong>In-class Conduct:</strong> Please turn off all cell phones or other 
  electronic devices while in class. Do not use them for texting; do not check 
  your messages during class. Do not use computers or class time for anything 
  other than English 5376 related work. Do not work on computers while someone 
  (instructor or student) is speaking to the class as a whole. In general, treat 
  each other and the instructor with respect and follow simple standards of common 
  courtesy.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Honesty/Plagiarism:</strong> The university will not tolerate 
  plagiarism or any other form of intellectual/academic dishonesty. This course 
  will abide by University policies in regard to academic conduct. Please refer 
  to the current TAMU-CC Catalog for information.</p>
<p><strong>Student with Disabilities:</strong> The Americans with Disabilities 
  Act (ADA) requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning 
  environment that provides for reasonable accommodations of their disabilities. 
  If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please contact 
  the Disability Services Office at (361) 825-5816 or visit the office in Driftwood 
  101.</p>
<p><strong>Writing Center:</strong> The Writing Center of Texas A&amp;M Corpus 
  Christi provides free help for students at any stage in the writing process, 
  including graduate students. Consultants can help you find ideas, organize thoughts, 
  cite sources, prepare application letters and resumes, and in general provide 
  an active, constructive audience for any writing task. Consultants work one-on-one 
  with students in confidential sessions, but if students request documentation 
  of their visit, it can be provided. The Writing Center is located in the Tutoring 
  and Learning Center in Bell Library 216, in the back, behind the science tutors. 
  Please drop in or make an appointment. As you work on your projects, you should 
  consider going there for some additional feedback as very often a person with 
  another viewpoint can help us to see different approaches we can take in our 
  writing processes. </p>
