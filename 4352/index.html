			<h2>Accessibility and Course Delivery</h2>
      <p>I work continually to ensure this course’s design, delivery, and policies are as radically <a href="https://webaim.org/" target="_blank">accessible</a> as I can make them. I am here to help you succeed. If you have questions or <a href="#ada">specific accessibility needs</a> that are not being met, I welcome dialogue with you.</p>
      <p> I work on the basic assumptions of an ethics of care: 1) We’re all people and deserve to be treated like people. 2) Your well-being is important to me. 3) I will do what I can to be flexible and responsive to situations, and ask that you do the same.</p>

			<p>This course meets in a blended format. We will meet together on Mondays and Wednesdays from 12:00-12:55 in CCH 207; we will use Fridays for individual conferences and asynchronous components.</p>

			<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
			<p>This course is the culminating experience for the Writing Studies emphasis in English. The course invites you to review, reflect on, integrate, and apply your learning from previous courses and experiences.  You will create digital portfolios for career and publishing opportunities, emphasizing selection, revision, reflection, and presentation. In addition, you will research current issues facing writing programs and English departments and create a recommendation report necessary curricular or pedagogical revisions for the English department and Writing Studies track.</p>

			<h2>Required Materials</h2>
			<p>No textbooks are required for this course; We will use articles and resources available online and through the <a href="https://tamucc.edu/library/" target="_blank">Bell Library</a>.</p>
      <p>You will also need to rely on the books, articles, and other resources that you have used in the Writing Studies courses you have completed before this course.</p>
      <p>You should have an activated Office365 account. TAMU-CC offers students free access to Office 365; visit <a href="https://www.tamucc.edu/information-technology/get-started/technology-resources.php" target="_blank">TAMUCC Student Technology Resources</a>. We will use Word Online for peer review and feedback, and you can also install the desktop version on your personal computer.</p>

			<h2 id="projects">Graded Activities</h2>
			<p>Complete descriptions, requirements, evaluation criteria, and rubrics are available on Blackboard. I will use the grading scale as described in the University <em>Catalog</em>. MLA or APA should consistently be used for manuscript formatting and citations, except when the writing situations you are participating in require/anticipate other options. You will use One Drive as a repository for your work throughout the semester.</p>
      <p>Dates are tentative</p>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Preparation and Process">Preparation and Process</h3>
				<p><em>20% of final grade</em> (Each week)</p>
				<ul>
          <li>Every memo, draft, revision, editing, and final submission of in-class and homework due for the portfolios will count in this category. If you are absent on a day when a draft is due but post your draft on the BB discussion forum before the deadline, you will receive credit for the draft. Credit for reading/responding to drafts online (if absent) may be made up, see note below re: late work/extensions.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="media/">Reading Journal</a></strong>&mdash;For each reading, provide three quotes along with a minimum 50-word response for each. (10 entries)</li>
          <li><strong><a href="media/">Reflecting, Re-visioning, Reflecting Activity Memo</a></strong>&mdash;Four times this semester, you will choose an assignment you have done in a previous course, reflect on what you did, how it contributed to your learning, what you could do to revise it, re-seeing it in a different way. You will consider how the experience might contribute to future learning and what kinds of learning / knowledge you may be able to "transfer" forward.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="media/">Learning and Engagement Memo</a></strong>&mdash;Four times this semester, you will reflect on how you have engaged with the course work during the preceding week(s) and consider how your learning has expanded, as you consider our current course and previous courses and learning experiences. In these reflections, you will use our course outcomes to frame and focus your reflections. These overviews will refer to specific evidence to support your reflections. </li>
        </ul>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Strategic Portfolios">Strategic Portfolios 1 &amp; 2</h3>
				<p><em>Portfolio 1: Job Search/Grad School Materials: 20% of final grade</em> | <a href="portfolio-1">Full description</a></p>
				<p><em>Portfolio 2: Capstone Portfolio; 40% of final grade</em> | <a href="portfolio-2">Full description</a></p>
				<p>Throughout the semester, you will work on developing / assembling two "Strategic Portfolios."  By "strategic" we will mean that these portfolios are meant for a specific purpose, individual, organization, or goal; P1 will be a collection of materials appropriate for a professional job application; P2 will be a capstone portfolio.</p>
        <p>You will complete the following steps in this development process, documenting your work for each step. By the end of the semester, you will have two portfolios that represent you as a learner and a writer, highlighting your skills by presenting examples of work you have done and by presenting thoughtful analyses / reflections on your skills, knowledge, and experience as represented by the work you share.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>explore, select presentation platform / software tool(s)</li>
          <li>develop frameworks for and determine usability of design choices</li>
          <li>develop frameworks that most effectively demonstrate your overall integration and synthesis of learning in your Writing Studies work</li>
          <li>select evidence, using frameworks to evaluate and choose</li>
          <li>share & respond, revise, edit selected evidence</li>
          <li>draft, share & respond, revise, edit reflective overviews</li>
          <li><strong>Portfolio Presentations</strong>: When each portfolio is due, you will briefly present it to the class and explain the choices you made, how these reflect and synthesize your learning and engagement from this course and previous courses and experiences.</li>
        </ul>

				<h3 data-toc-text="Revised Research">Revised Research Project</h3>
				<p><em>20% of final grade</em> | <a href="revised">Full description</a></p>
				<p>You will write a polished, well-researched article, conference presentation, or other research-based publication, based on a previously written project. In class discussions and assignments, we will take a particular focus on research methods for writing studies, and part of your task will be to revisit and possibly expand your research methods for that project. To support your work, we will work from Try This: Research Methods for Writers, an open-access text from the WAC Clearinghouse (<a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/books/practice/try/" target="_blank">https://wac.colostate.edu/books/practice/try/</a>).  This project will be an extended process with several steps.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Research Plan, including targeted journal or conference, audience, and intended changes</li>
          <li>Consultation: Notes from a consultation with appropriate expert in the field</li>
          <li>Reflection on and articulation of appropriate research methods</li>
          <li>Serious, global revision</li>
          <li>Close careful editing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Submitting assignments</h3>
        <p>Most writing assignments must be submitted through Blackboard, usually as documents or links to e-portfolios or websites. This may mean you submit a link to a folder or an e-portfolio. All students now have access to Office 365, Microsoft’s online version of the Office software suite, at no charge. Unless otherwise directed, do not send coursework to the instructor via email.</p>
