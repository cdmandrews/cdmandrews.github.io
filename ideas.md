# praxis idea:

what sort of thing can I make with my students that works with their distant readings (word clouds)? What do they do, and what is the publication?

I suppose it's kind of testing the assertion (especially by Mueller) that word clouds are a good form of novice-centric word-watching, useful for graduate students entering the field to get a kind of loose "network sense" that could be followed up with other activities.

This doesn't mean we'd be truly testing that assertion as research, but certainly putting that assertion to the test.

Is such a webtext (of course a webtext) a reflection on a "method" and methodological reenactment? What is it we're understanding here?

Digital rhetoric's digital rhetoric (the problem of introducing a field to students who didn't even know the field's a field or if they did didn't have much sense of what it meant (rhetoric, much less digital rhetoric, being alien space and time.))

I see a text that puts together (clean) versions of the class' word clouds, inviting reflection and generative (proairetic) perspective on pattern-delivering. Thus reading digital rhetoric via digital rhetoric (de Brooke and Eyman and others). Create a hypertextual reflection that describes and assesses what we see, what we read, how we follow up on it, and how we did it. Include some instructor reflection. A gallery of word clouds and superclouds at various levels of scalability. And inviting the sorts of questioning that we can do with that kind of information? 

Do we include other journals? Where do we stop? How do we ensure "method" to our madness? I think this is what I want to work on with my students for the next X weeks. We could drop the rhetorical analysis for the most part and just work on this and the nannotated bibliography for the rest of the semester and I'd be happy. Would they? Of course working through a multimodal production would be interesting.

Have to query michael and see hwat the editors think. And have to map out the work over seven weeks. Need lit review, collection, noticing, archiving, etc.

Need standard text files to analyze, probably a collaborative zotero doc for bibliography noticing

# praxiswiki (?) ideas:

## HTML is still okay with me. Applying the manifesto.

Teaching markup, content permissions, web publishing, learning not to fear the tech, and media copyright with a basic HTML5/CSS activity.

Reports on the writing for the web assignment described at https://cdmandrews.github.io/teaching/fa18-3379/directory.html  (have gone around between publishing via github pages and LMS to manage submission of pages)

Especially important: the lofi manifesto; this is essentially a module that enacts that.
 - learning *about* markup languages and the structure of web content (really forcing a level of abstraction on writing--not just form/content, but semantic/structure)
 - learning languages and functions and semantics, not software
 - learning how to learn about technology (esp. important for students at my regional HSI)
 - learning ethical/legal issues surrounding media reuse and copyright

humanity as a way to push back against the tyranny of techno/culturalism:

<blockquote> "When writers write and revise by hand to make digital things, they introduce a missing human element and human timescale into the process and the production" (Stolley, lofi 2.0)</blockquote>
