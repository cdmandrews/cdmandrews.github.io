# Different versions of my bios, academic and industry:

Mostly for record-keeping and comparative purposes, also to ensure I have a central location for these to keep me from constantly feeling like I am starting from scratch on author bios.

Writing is hard, folx.

## Web portfolio site homepage blurb, 2016ff

As a technorhetorician, I teach young professionals how to write, engage, advocate, and continually professionalize by using rhetoric in a writing-rich and media-slick world. I research and write about how technical and professional communicators use digital and social writing to learn, connect, create, and share. I serve the discipline and other institutions with writing and multimodal editing expertise in HTML and other technologies. I advocate for institutions, groups, and individuals to critically engage with and through technology, trying to live out Andrew Feenberg's call to question technology by focusing on human ends rather than technical ease.
